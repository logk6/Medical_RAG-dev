Each of the handbooks that have been published during the intervening years was developed by a team of authorities coor- dinated by editors who had earned international respect and recognition in the areas of sports med- icine and the sport sciences. Since the appearance of the ﬁ rst publication, handbooks have appeared that have dealt with 10 Olympic sports as well as the general top- ics of strength training and nutrition for ath- letes. Sections dealing with sports injuries have appeared throughout these handbooks. Two vol- umes of the other IOC Medical Commission series, Encyclopaedia of Sports Medicine, have been devoted completely to injuries in sport. The protection of the health of the athletes is one of the IOC’s priorities. Therefore, the understanding of injuries and their prevention became one of the focuses of the Medical Commission and the Medical and Scientiﬁ c Department of the IOC. The principal objective of this Handbook on Sports Injury Prevention is a comprehensive review of the information currently available regarding the identiﬁ cation of the risk factors for speciﬁ c injuries in each sport, the understanding of the injury mechanisms, the appropriate condition- ing of athletes for the particular sport, and the risk management appropriate to each activity. The Handbook on Sports Injury Prevention constitutes the most comprehensive review of the preclusion of the occurrence of injuries pres- ently available and each section presents highly practical information based on published science. We welcome this splendid contribution by Roald Bahr, MD, PhD, Lars Engebretsen, MD, PhD, and 36 contributing authors to the literature of sports medicine and sports science."}

Sometimes they are difﬁ cult, even impossible, to explain. But fre- quently there are clear patterns. And when there are patterns, there are also opportunities for reduc- ing the risk of injury. The objective of this book is to describe those opportunities – for the beneﬁ t of everyone playing sports. Although it may be expected that the main readership will be physicians, trainers and physical therapists working with sports teams, the coach- ing staff is an even more important target group. And although it is assumed that the reader has a basic knowledge of human anatomy and physiol- ogy, ultimately the main audience is of course the athlete. With these target groups in mind, we have attempted to create a work that is at once com- prehensive in approach, practical in content, and accessible in delivery. Our intention is to describe a practical approach to the prevention of sports injuries."}
{"id": "15", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "The ﬁ rst three chapters describe the general principles of injury prevention. Chapter 1 discusses why injury preven- tion in sports is important, including perspectives on short- and long term consequences for health and performance. Chapter 2 describes the basis for intervention, how information on risk factors and injury mechanisms can be used to identify patterns. Such patterns can be used to identify athletes with a higher risk for injury or situations with a propensity for injury; information which is critical to be able to target and develop preven- tive programs. Chapter 3 describes how an injury prevention program can be developed and imple- mented within the team. In this context, a team can also mean a team of athletes competing in individual sports, such as a team of alpine skiers. One choice we faced when planning this book, was whether to organize the contents per sport or per body part/injury type. One advantage of describing sports-speciﬁ c programs is that it would be possible to detail measures particular to that sport, for example equipment-related meas- ures such as alpine ski bindings. However, partly because some such information is available already (e.g. vol. V of the Encyclopedia of Sports Medicine series: Clinical Practice of Sports Injury Prevention and Care, ed."}

Chapters 4 through 12 therefore describes how the most common sports injury types can be prevented; ankle, knee, hamstring, groin, low back, shoulder, elbow, head and cervical spine injuries. The ﬁ nal two chapters discusses how tendon overuse injuries, which represent a major problem across sports and body region, can be pre- vented (ch.12) and how large-scale injury preven- tion programs can be implemented (ch.13). Each of the region-speciﬁ c chapters includes an introduction outlining how relevant each injury type is in each of the main Olympic sports. In con- trast to previous works on sports injury epidemiol- ogy, we have attempted to keep this section brief and to the point, answering the key questions: ix Preface"}

This includes a description of the various internal and external risk factors suggested for the injury in question, emphasizing modiﬁ able risk factors and how the coach/medical team can identify play- ers at risk of injury. In some cases, simple tests or screening methods which can be applied to a team setting are described. This section is followed by a description of the typical injury mechanisms for the injury in question, not just the biomechan- ics of injury, but also the circumstances leading to injury, such as player behavior, opponent behav- ior, the playing situation, or other relevant factors. We have also asked all authors to provide a section identifying risks in the training and competition program, a risk analysis to document the parts of the season when athletes are at the greatest risk for sustaining injuries as a result of the training or competitive programs. For some injury types, this type of analysis could be an important basis for planning preventive measures, particularly for the purpose of avoiding overuse injuries during tran- sitional periods. The ﬁ nal – and most important – section of each of these chapters is the section on prevention methods. This section discusses pos- sible ways to prevent the injury in question, and although these may be relevant across sports, the text provides examples from sports where injury prevention has been successful."}

This represents a signiﬁ cant challenge, since there is no model available to guide us in the development of the contents. We wish to thank the authors, who have worked hard to not just provide an up- to-date description of injury prevention methods relevant to their region and injury type, but also to develop a text consistent in content and format across the various chapters.

The numerous health beneﬁ ts of physi- cal activity have been well documented, result- ing in public health support of regular physical activity and exercise. Although beneﬁ cial, exercise and sports also have corresponding risks, includ- ing that of musculoskeletal injuries. However, at a time when there is an abundance of medical meetings, journals, and papers, some might argue that the last thing we need is a new book focus- ing on yet another ﬁ eld of research and clinical practice. What would justify such an emphasis on a new and developing ﬁ eld in medicine?First, it must ask important questions not answered by others. Second, the new research ﬁ eld should have the potential to create truly new knowledge, lead to new ways of thinking and lay the founda- tion for improved health for our patients. This is usually not possible without a multidisciplinary approach, involving a mixture of basic scientists and clinicians. Third, research results from the new ﬁ eld should be publishable in respected journals, recognized and cited by peers, presentable at high- quality meetings, and fundable on competitive grant review."}
{"id": "20", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Let us examine each of these issues to see if there is sufﬁ cient merit in sports injury pre- vention research. Is injury prevention important?First, is injury prevention important?Epidemiologi- cal studies show that of injuries seen by a physi- cian, in Scandinavia, every sixth is sustained during sporting activity (Bahr et al.,2002). Among children, every third hospital-treated injury is the result of sports participation (Bahr et al.,2002). During 1997 and 1998, in the United States, annu- ally there were an estimated 3.7 million sports- and recreation-related emergency department visits annually in the United States, representing approx- imately 11% of all injury related emergency depart- ment visits; 2.6 million visits were among persons aged 5–24 years. The medical charges for these vis- its were estimated at 500 million US$ annually. The risk of injury clearly differs between sports, as documented by a study initiated by the IOC Medical Commission in team sports during the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens (Junge et al.,"}

As shown in Table 1.1, while a soccer and handball player suffered one injury every 10th match he or she play, a volleyball player at the elite level only had an injury every 100th match on the average. Not all of these injuries are serious; in fact only about half of all the injuries recorded were Sports Injury Prevention, 1st edition. Edited by R. Bahr and L.

Nevertheless, when taking injury severity into account, a research group within the English Football Association found that the overall risk to professional athletes is unacceptably high—approximately 1000 times higher among professional football players than for high-risk industrial occupations (Drawer & Fuller, 2002) (Figure 1.1). Although football and handball rank highest in injury rates of the team sports included in the Olympic summer program, there are actually other sports where the injury rate is considerably higher, for example, ice hockey and the other football codes: American football, rugby, and Australian rules football. Some injury types, such as serious head and knee injuries, are a particular cause of concern. Head injuries are known to have a high incidence among alpine skiers and snowboarders, especially among snowboarders, and the frequency increases year by year in this group. Head injury is the most frequent reason for hospital admission and most common cause of death among skiers and snow- boarders with an 8% mortality rate among those admitted to hospital with head injuries. Among injuries related to football, 4–22% are head injuries. The reported incidence during matches—1.7 inju- ries per 1000 player hours—incorporates all types of head injuries including facial fractures, contu- sions, lacerations, and eye injuries (Andersen et al., 2004). The estimated incidence of concussion— 0.5 injuries per 1000 match hours—probably repre- sents a minimum estimate due to the problem of deﬁ ning and grading concussions (Andersen et al.,"}
{"id": "23", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "2004). Although most athletes with head injuries recover uneventfully following a single concus- sive episode, repetitive mild head trauma may be implicated in the development of cumulative cog- nitive deterioration. Based on paper and pencil tests, cumulative effects of repeated concussions have been found to cause deterioration in neu- ropsychological function among athletes in other sports such as American football and boxing, as well as in non-athletes. The highest incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries is seen in 15- to 25-year-old athletes in pivoting sports such as football, basketball and handball. This incidence is three to ﬁ ve times higher among women than men (Grifﬁ n et al.,2006). In 1970, Kennedy stated that “the anterior cruciate lig- ament is the most common cause of the exathlete.” In other words, the treatment offered at the time did not permit athletes to go back to sport. This is no longer the case, at least in the short term, thanks to the advances in sports medicine research, with major improvements in surgical techniques and rehabilita- tion programs. Today, most elite athletes are initially able to resume their sports career, should they wish to do so."}
{"id": "24", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "And although the retirement rate may be higher among athletes with a previous ACL injury compared with healthy athletes, the main concern is the dramatically increased risk of long-term seque- lae—like abnormal joint dynamics and early onset of degenerative joint disease. Importantly, we still lack evidence to suggest that reconstructive surgery of either menisci or cruciate ligaments decrease the rate of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA). After 10 years, approximately half of the patients display signs of OA, and it appears that the majority of the patients will have osteoarthrosis after 15–20 years (Figure 1.2) (Myklebust & Bahr, 2005).

Is there an evidence base for injury prevention?The second issue relates to the potential for new ideas and improved health outcomes. In May 2000, a PubMed search revealed that out of 10,691 papers on athletic injury, there were only six ran- domized controlled trials (RCTs) on sports injury prevention (Table 1.2). However, a similar search of the literature in December 2007 revealed that sports injury prevention research is emerging as a new ﬁ eld in medicine. While the number of studies on athletic injuries has increased by 43% over the last 7 years, clinical studies and RCTs related to sports injury prevention has increased by 200–300% (Table 1.2). Gradually, congresses in sports medicine, orthopedics, and traumatology include an increasing number of symposia, lectures, and instructional courses on injury prevention issues. Research is also improving in quality, not only in quantity. For example, recent issues of high-impact general medical journals such as the British Medical Journal and the Journal of the American Medical Association have included several papers related to injury prevention; two case-control studies among Unacceptable risk Tolerable risk Acceptable risk Negligible risk 1000 Football 100 10 1 0.1 0.01 0.001 Slight (1–3 days) Minor (4–7 days) Moderate Injury severity (time absent from work/play) Major (\u00014 weeks) Fatality Injury risk (injuries per 100,000 h of exposure, log scale) Football Football Football Football–OA Manufacturing Construction Service Construction Manufacturing Service Construction Figure 1.1."}

Many major public health and specialty journals are currently publishing new studies in this ﬁ eld. The publication of these studies in highly respected medical, physical therapy and nursing journal illustrates that sports injury preven- tion is an important public health issue. Is sports participation healthy?Sports participation is important from a public health perspective. There is no longer any doubt that regular physical activity reduces the risk of premature mortality in general, and of coronary heart disease, hypertension, colon cancer, obesity, and diabetes mellitus in particular."}

The overall life expectancy was higher in the high-level athlete compared to a matched refer- ence group (75.6 versus 69.9 years). They also showed that the rate of hospitalization was lower for endurance sports and power sports compared to the reference group (Kujala et al.,1996). This resulted from a lower rate of hospital care for heart disease, respiratory disease, and cancer. However, the athletes were more likely to have been hospi- talized for musculoskeletal disorders. A follow-up study revealed that former team sport athletes had a higher risk of knee OA, and other studies have documented an increased risk of hip and knee arthritis among former football players. Thus, the evidence suggests that although sports participa- tion is beneﬁ cial, injuries are a signiﬁ cant side effect."}

{"id": "30", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Why is injury prevention in sports important?5 Injury prevention is a complex process. To pre- vent injury, scientists must ﬁ rst correctly identify one or several risk factors, the mechanisms of injury, devise an effective intervention to modify it, implement the intervention with sufﬁ cient compliance, and study the outcome of the inter- vention with a method that is sensitive enough to detect reductions in the injury rate which are clin- ically meaningful. When prevention is successful or fails, it may not always be clear which step in this chain of events was deﬁ cient. This complexity makes injury prevention difﬁ cult, but not impos- sible. A number of interventions have shown a reduction in injury rates, that is, ACL injuries in team handball and soccer; ankle injuries in soccer, basketball and volleyball; head injuries in hockey and skiing; wrist injuries in snowboarding; and hamstrings injuries in Australian Rules football and soccer. The list is increasing year by year for the beneﬁ t of the athlete and the sports. The future of injury prevention Do we need to further develop prevention pro- grams in the future?Year by year we seem to have more information about risk factors and their rela- tive roles. If the relative additional risk of having speciﬁ c risk factors is known, some individuals should probably be advised against participation in certain sports where the risk factor cannot be eliminated."}
{"id": "31", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "On the contrary, if the effect of elimi- nating one risk factor after another is known, indi- viduals may be able to participate in sports with low risk if they are compliant with their speciﬁ c training program. The goal must be to reach a stage where the risk factors are known and where we can assign a relative risk of an injury to individ- uals. During the preseason examination, individu- als with risk factors can then be assigned training programs that have been validated. Even at this stage, future research in this ﬁ eld is necessary. The nature of sports is always changing—becoming faster and generally more demanding. Just think of the difference in alpine skiing over the last 25 years. In almost any sports the same increase in pace is seen. Thus, research on risk factors and injury mechanisms must be ongoing and intervention studies crucial. In an evolving ﬁ eld such as this, international cooperation is critical. The involvement of the IOC, which highlights sports injury prevention research in this book, improves the dissemination of information around the world."}

These include greater health of the individual; longevity in the activity; and reduced costs to the individual, the sport, the health care system, and society. An obvious beneﬁ t is the potential for bet- ter performance through injury prevention. This may be particularly relevant when trying to moti- vate athletes, coaches, and sports teams to focus on injury prevention. The likelihood of success is greater if all the best players on the team are avail- able for team selection. And the chance of success is nil if you are injured when the Olympics start!Prevention can be grouped into three broad categories of primary, secondary, and tertiary pre- vention. Primary prevention is the goal of most prevention activity, and is what most people think of when they consider prevention. That is, primary prevention involves the avoidance of injury (e.g., ankle braces being worn by an entire team, even those with no history of previous ankle sprains). If primary prevention activities are successful, an individual will not sustain injury in the ﬁ rst place."}
{"id": "39", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "This differs from secondary prevention which involves appropriate early diagnosis and treat- ment once an injury has occurred. The aim here is to ensure that the injury is optimally cared for to limit the development of disability, and is what most people think of as treatment (e.g., early RICE treatment of an ankle sprain). Finally, tertiary prevention is the focus on reha- bilitation to reduce and/or correct an existing dis- ability attributed to an underlying disease; what most people think of as rehabilitation (e.g., in the case of a patient who has had an ankle sprain, this would involve balance board exercises and wearing an ankle brace while gradually returning to sport). Sequence of injury prevention research In 1992, van Mechelen outlined a sequence of injury prevention research (Figure 2.1). This con- ceptual model can be successfully applied by sports medicine staff, as well. First, according to the research model, the magnitude of the problem must be identiﬁ ed and described in terms of the incidence and severity of sports injuries. If you are responsible for a team, this would involve monitoring injury risk on a continuous basis by recording all injuries within the squad, as well as training and match participation (often called “exposure”). As a second step in injury prevention research, the risk factors and injury mechanisms must be identiﬁ ed that play a part in causing sports injuries to occur. For the medical team and coaching staff, this could involve systematic steps to examine the athletes and their training and competition program. The third step is to introduce measures that are likely to reduce the future risk and/or severity of injuries."}

From a researcher’s standpoint, it is preferable to evalu- ate the effect of preventive measures by means of a randomized controlled trial. For the team staff, continuous surveillance of the injury pattern within the team will reveal whether the changes occur in the injury risk (providing the medical staff realize that changes in patterns of injury over time in a sin- gle team can be due to many different factors). Injury surveillance The object of surveillance is to enumerate the extent of injury in a given group or population. In this book, the rate of speciﬁ c injury types across dif- ferent sports will be reported. Based on surveillance data from previous studies, we can learn which injury types should be targeted when considering injury prevention in different sports. Surveillance within a speciﬁ c team, league, or sport organization can also highlight potential areas of prevention that might be unique to that group. A soccer coach may want to focus on hamstring strains, knee and ankle sprains, whereas a baseball coach may decide to con- sider shoulder and elbow problems when planning his training and competition program. However, injury rate is not the only factor to be considered."}
{"id": "42", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Injury severity is also an important concern. For example, serious knee injuries or head injuries may warrant particular attention, not based on injury rate alone, but because they can potentially result in permanent disability and even death. However, when comparing results between stud- ies in different sports and different sports settings, there are a number of important characteristics of surveillance that must be considered, including the injury deﬁ nition. There is also the question of diagnostic coding or classiﬁ cation of injury and issues surrounding the count of injury and rein- jury, and assessment of severity. Injury deﬁ nition Deﬁ ning what constitutes an injury is not as easy as it may seem at ﬁ rst glance, and there have been many different approaches to injury deﬁ ni- tion in the past. A consensus statement was issued in 2006 in the sport of football (soccer) stating that the broadest deﬁ nition of injury would be any event occurring as a result of participation in sport (Fuller et al.,2006). Injury was then fur- ther classiﬁ ed into medical attention injuries; those that required assessment or treatment by a medi- cal practitioner. A further sub-division was time- loss injuries; those causing a player to miss one or more practices or games or sessions. The impor- tant point in any research regarding injury surveil- lance is that one must know in advance exactly what will be counted, and this must be consistent across all people and all groups recording injury."}
{"id": "43", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "This is important to ensure consistency both within a given period of surveillance and over time between different periods of surveillance.

However, within the context of sport the most meaningful meas- ure is likely the amount of time an individual is unable to participate in their customary activity of training or competition. Obviously, career-ending injuries or injuries causing permanent disability, or even death, are a particular concern. The “time lost” can be counted in days or sessions (games or practices) missed. The total time lost from injury within a team can be used to monitor the qual- ity of not only the efﬁ ciency of the medical team in diagnosing and treating injuries, but also the injury prevention program within the team. Injury recurrence In counting injuries, it is important to realize that all injuries are not isolated events. That is, some injuries are a recurrence of something that has happened previously, either pre-dating or dur- ing the same period of data collection. Fuller et al. (2007) have recommended that recurrence be grouped into “exacerbations” and “reinju- ries.”Exacerbations should not be counted as a new injury event, but any time missed should be attributed to the ﬁ rst injury."}
{"id": "46", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "In contrast, reinjuries should be counted as a separate injury event with their own time loss. If injury surveillance within a team reveals an unusually high rate or proportion of recurrences, this could mean that injury reha- bilitation is insufﬁ cient or that athletes are allowed too early return to play after previous injuries. Exposure With injury surveillance one can look at numbers of new injuries over a period of time. However, within the context of sport where there is varying degrees of participation (and therefore exposure to the potential of injury), it is more meaningful to capture injuries in reference to the amount of time that a given individual participates. Participation can be counted in hours or sessions. From this, an injury rate, or incidence rate, can be calculated. In this book injury incidence is typically reported as the number of injuries per 1000 hours of player exposure. This allows injury risk to be compared between different sports and different groups. Determining the causes of injury If one is to prevent injury, the causes of injuries must be determined. First, one must identify those factors associated with an increased risk of injury (“risk factors”)."}
{"id": "47", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Risk factors Although all individuals possess certain character- istics or factors, they are considered risk factors if they increase the chance of an injury occurring. However, the assessment of risk can be complex, since most factors in sport do not act in isolation. A risk factor may be part of a collection of other factors that, together, produce a picture of “suf- ﬁ cient cause” for an injury to occur. Sometimes, one speciﬁ c risk factor is necessary and without this factor, an injury will not occur (Meeuwisse, 1994; Meeuwisse et al.,2007). There are many factors that impact on the poten- tial occurrence of injury. There are internal or intrin- sic risk factors that are part of an athlete’s make up that may make them predisposed to injury. Then, they begin to participate and are exposed to external or extrinsic factors, which may make them suscep- tible to injury. These risk factors (often in combi- nation) will determine whether a speciﬁ c event or force will produce an injury (Figure 2.2). In some cases the risk factor that is being evalu- ated is not the cause of injury."}
{"id": "48", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Interestingly, if the factor is shown to be associated with an increased risk of injury it is considered a risk factor. This allows this factor to be a valid predictor or marker of injury. However, removing the risk factor may not necessarily prevent injury if a causal relation- ship does not exist. Etiology In some instances the immediate cause (or eti- ology) of injury is obvious. However, all is not always what it appears to be. Even in the most obvious examples, there is often more than one factor that has led to the injury.

Therefore, it is important to take a more encom- passing view of etiology or causation. A model has been developed in the past to account for a number of different variables that may contribute to injury. Meeuwisse (1994) outlined a model wherein an athlete begins with a certain set of characteristics (Figure 2.2). These are typically referred to as intrinsic risk factors or internal fac- tors which may predispose the athlete for injury. This includes athlete characteristics: factors such as age, maturation, gender, body composition, and ﬁ tness level. One factor that consistently has been documented to be a signiﬁ cant predictor is previous injury—almost regardless of the injury type studied. Intrinsic factors such as these interact to predispose for injury, or in other cases protect from injury. Examples of factors which may make an athlete less predisposed to some, but not all, injury types include ﬁ tness-related factors such as muscle mass, strength, balance, and neuromuscular control."}
{"id": "50", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "An athlete then begins to participate in sport within a certain environment and is exposed to extrinsic risk factors. These may include equipment and ﬁ eld conditions, for example, ﬂ oor friction in indoor team sports, snow conditions in alpine skiing, a slippery surface (running track), very cold weather, or inappropriate footwear. Extrinsic factors may also reduce injury risk, such as the wearing of protec- tive equipment. Exposure to such external risk fac- tors may interact with the intrinsic factors to make the athlete more or less susceptible to injury. When intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors act simultaneously, the athlete may be at far greater risk of injury than when risk factors are present in isolation. The ﬁ nal link in the chain is the inciting event, which is usually referred to as the injury mechanism—what we see when watching an injury situation. Each injury type and each sport does have its typical patterns, and for team medi- cal and coaching staff it is important to understand the typical injuries and mechanisms in their sport (Bahr & Krosshaug, 2005). It has been recognized more recently that this process should not be seen as linear and static. Risk factors for injury (distant from outcome) Injury mechanisms (proximal to outcome) Intrinsic risk factors: • Age • Gender • Body composition (e.g., body weight, fat mass, BMD, anthropometry) • Health (e.g., history of previous injury, joint instability) • Physical fitness (e.g., muscle strength/power, maximal O2 uptake, joint ROM) • Anatomy (e.g., alignment, intercondylar notch width) • Skill level (e.g., sport- specific technique, postural stability) Inciting event: • Playing situation • Player/opponent “behavior” • Biomechanical characteristics Exposure to extrinsic risk factors: • Human factors (e.g., team mates, opponents, referee) • Protective equipment (e.g., helmet, shin guards) • Sports equipment (e.g., skis) • Environment (e.g., weather, snow and ice conditions, floor and turf type, maintenance) INJURY Predisposed athlete Susceptible athlete Figure 2.2.

{"id": "51", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "A systematic approach to sports injury prevention 11 That is, it does not have a clear starting and ending point in the context of sport. Athletes par- ticipate in sport over typically a long period of time and bring with them characteristics of prior training as well as other sport experience and injury. Moreover, they carry their intrinsic risk fac- tors with them into repeated exposure to extrinsic risk factors and many potentially inciting events, most of which never result in injury. Therefore, one limitation of the model is that it is not obvious how the athlete’s training routine and competitive schedule can be taken into considera- tion as potential causes, and the model has there- fore traditionally mainly been used to describe the causes of acute injuries. For overuse injuries, the causative factors can sometimes be distant from the outcome. For example, for a stress fracture in a long distance runner the inciting event is not usu- ally the single training session when pain became evident, but the training and competition program he or she has followed over the previous weeks or months. Another limitation is that repeated exposure may produce adaptation, either in the course of normal training or as a consequence of being exposed to potentially injurious events. Overuse or gradual onset injuries are typically produced as a result of high training loads over a period of time. In some athletes, these training loads will result in adapta- tion and the athlete will actually become stronger and therefore have an improved (reduced) set of intrinsic risk factors. In other athletes, this may result in tissue breakdown and microtraumatic changes that would worsen (increase) their intrin- sic risk factors."}
{"id": "52", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Ultimately, this happens on a cyclical basis for every single participation in sport (Meeuwisse et al.,2007). As athletes are exposed to the play- ing environment and face different events, some of those will become an inciting event and therefore a mechanism for injury. Others, however, produce no injury but rather adaptations in the athlete, which may be biomechanical, structural, behavio- ral, etc. Then, these athletes repeatedly participate in sport, creating a dynamic cycle wherein repeat participation can result in either injury or no injury. Therefore, it is important to keep in mind that risks will change under repeated participation. This is not just because of external changes such as dif- ferences in weather or playing surfaces or equip- ment worn. Internal risk factors can also change as a result of participation. Speciﬁ cally, an ath- lete’s susceptibility to tissue-level damage may be reduced as strength improves with repeated use or as technique becomes adapted in a positive man- ner. At the same time, repeat participation can produce microtrauma that weakens tissue and increases susceptibility to injury."}
{"id": "53", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "In addition, ath- letes may change their behavior, their style of play or even their choice of protective equipment based on a perceived susceptibility or risk of injury. These circumstances do not tend to remain constant even within one player over the course of time. Rather, adaptations or changes may occur during a season through both training and competition. The behavior of these factors have been described in more detail by Meeuwisse et al. (2007). Modiﬁ able and non-modiﬁ able risk factors Assuming that a risk factor is a cause of injury, the best way to prevent injury is to change the risk factor. For example, a risk factor of muscle weak- ness can be overcome with a strengthening pro- gram, or a risk factor of poor proprioception can be improved by balance re-training. In addition, if artiﬁ cial turf were a risk factor, it could be mini- mized by playing on grass. However, in some cases, the risk factor cannot be changed, eliminated, or modiﬁ ed. Even so, non- modiﬁ able factors (such as gender) may be equally important in injury prevention if they can be used to target intervention measures to those athletes who are at increased risk."}

For example, one may consider being struck in the face by a hockey puck or stick as a completely random event, which could occur regardless of intrinsic or extrinsic risk factors. If defenders and attackers are hit as often as goalies, it may not be possible to identify the player at risk. And even if the chance of being struck were twice as high for goalkeepers, a face mask would be the obvious preventive measure and the key question would be how to design such a mask, and not who should wear it. To fully understand the inciting event, and the ultimate chain in the factors leading to injury, it is helpful to use a comprehensive model, which accounts for the events leading to the injury situa- tion (playing situation, player, and opponent behav- ior), as well as includes a description of whole body and joint biomechanics at the time of injury (Bahr & Krosshaug, 2005). Ideas for preventive measures may originate from each category of information, depending on the injury type in question. For some injury types, the key to prevention may lie with the events leading to the injury situ- ation (e.g., the playing situation, player behavior, or opponent behavior). For example, to prevent head injuries in soccer the ﬁ rst obvious question is: What strikes the head?The ball?Or is it a head- to-head clash with an opponent in a heading duel?"}
{"id": "56", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Or the opponent’s arm or elbow?Or do head inju- ries typically result when falling and hitting the ground?Recent studies from elite male soccer on the national and international level have shown that the commonest mechanism involved head- ing challenges and the use of the upper extrem- ity with elbow to head contact. In the majority of the elbow to head incidents, the elbow was used actively at or above shoulder level (Figure 2.3). From these ﬁ ndings stricter rule enforcement and even changes in the laws of the game concerning elbow use can be made to reduce the risk of head injury. In other sports, it may be more important to have detailed knowledge of the biomechanics. For example, to design an appropriate hockey hel- met, it is necessary to have an accurate estimate of the impact forces involved in the game, such as when a falling player hits the ice. Other examples of factors which may be important to understand and describe the injury mechanisms are shown in Table 2.1. Such information can be obtained from a variety of research methods, each with its own strengths and limitations. These include interviews of injured athletes, analysis of video recordings of actual injuries, clinical studies (where the clinical joint damage ﬁ ndings are studied to understand the injury mechanism through examination, diag- nostic imaging, or surgical exploration), in vivo studies (measuring ligament strain or forces to understand ligament loading patterns), cadaver studies, mathematical modeling and simulation of injury situations, or measurements/estimation from “close to injury” situations."}

The multifactorial nature of sport injuries is important to consider in these studies to understand why certain forces lead to injury in some cases, but not in others. Examples will be presented in the subsequent chapters deal- ing with speciﬁ c injury types. Developing intervention methods and programs The third stage in van Mechelen’s approach is the introduction of prevention measures. The devel- opment of injury intervention programs depends to a large extent on the previous step wherein causes of injuries are identiﬁ ed. Strategies for injury control have been developed from other research areas, particularly from research on motor vehicle accidents. One such model, the injury pre- vention matrix, has two dimensions (Table 2.2). One dimension relates to whether the measure is designed to avoid accidents altogether (pre- crash measures), to avoid injury even if an acci- dent occurs (crash measures), or whether it aims to minimize the consequences of an injury (post- crash measures). The other dimension relates to whether the measure targets the individual, the environment, or perhaps equipment used. Other categories are also possible along this dimension."}
{"id": "60", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Although Haddon (1980) originally developed the injury prevention matrix for motor vehicle accidents, it represents a useful approach for ana- lyzing potential injury prevention methods when applied to sports. Pre-crash measures Measures related to the pre-crash stage have been developed to counteract potential injury-causing situations by preventing accidents altogether. In sports, examples of athlete-related pre-crash meas- ures include ensuring adequate, sport speciﬁ c, physical conditioning of athletes, increasing their skill level, and improving neuromuscular con- trol and agility to avoid situations where they might get injured. Psychosocial variables may be addressed in an effort to inﬂ uence the athletes’ resiliency and injury vulnerability. In addition, sport-speciﬁ c screens may help identify athletes at risk for injury and modify their risk prior to partic- ipation. Examples of environmental pre-crash meas- ures include modifying the friction of the playing surface (too high may lead to twisting injuries to the lower extremity, too low may lead to slipping and falling injuries) or changing regulations to avoid dangerous plays. Equipment-related pre-crash measures include modifying shoe friction and choosing cleat length according to the playing sur- face and weather conditions. All of these measures are based on modifying risk factors that have been shown to be a cause (or part of a cause) of injury. Crash measures Measures related to the second stage, the crash stage, have been developed to protect the athlete against injuries if a potentially harmful situation arises. These measures mainly focus on assisting athletes to withstand the forces involved when a collision or a fall occurs."}

Post-crash measures Post-crash measures are designed to minimize the damage resulting from an injury and the risk of reinjury (which is a strong risk factor for sports injuries), and mainly relates to the chain of medi- cal treatment provided after an injury. Post-crash measures in sports may include providing adequate medical services during sports events (personnel and equipment); training athletes and coaches to provide adequate on-ﬁ eld ﬁ rst aid, including quick evacuation procedures to a hospital in the case of severe injuries, adequate rehabilitation programs for injured athletes and ensuring appropriate medi- cal clearance before they return to competition. Active versus passive measures Injury prevention measures can also be categorized as active or passive (Haddon, 1974). Examples from motor vehicle accident prevention are seat belts (active) which require the individual to fasten them, and air bags (passive) which do not require the operator to take any action. In between these extremes there are measures which require some action by individuals. An example is where speciﬁ c safety gear is required in the rules of the sport; that is, this requires some action by the individual, but this action is a prerequisite to be allowed to partici- pate. This is the case for helmet wear in ice hockey and competitive skiing and snowboarding. In con- trast, among recreational skiers and snowboard- ers, helmets are still not required by most skiing resorts. In this setting, helmet use must be consid- ered an active measure, dependent on education and attitudes with signiﬁ cant barriers in terms of cost and availability."}
{"id": "63", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "The distinctions are not merely classiﬁ cations. They have direct, practical relevance. Historically, passive approaches, when available, have a spec- tacularly more successful record in injury preven- tion outside of sport. This is also the case within the sports context, where there is a long tradi- tion for mandating safety equipment, and speciﬁ c safety standards for sports venues. For example, in leagues where the type of facial protection in ice hockey is optional, players at the varsity/college level have been shown to choose the minimum level mandated. There is an inherent level of risk that athletes appear to be willing to absorb, which may be a barrier to adopting active measures. Implementing injury prevention programs Once methods with a potential for prevention have been identiﬁ ed, there is a need to carefully develop the prevention measures, assess them under ideal conditions, and consider the imple- mentation context (Finch, 2006). An important part of the development of inter- ventions is ﬁ rst testing their efﬁ cacy. This means that under ideal conditions, they are tested to determine if the intervention works. This is typi- cally done in a controlled research setting with extensive monitoring and measurement of com- pliance with the intervention."}
{"id": "64", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "This differs from effectiveness, which is where an intervention is implemented in a broader context, often in a com- munity or sport setting, where the degree of atten- tion to the program and monitoring is much less. If we use the analogy of a drug, efﬁ cacy would be the question of whether the drug works under controlled conditions of ideal use. Effectiveness would measure whether the drug worked in a given patient, who may be affected by side effects, convenience of use, etc. Therefore, the culture of sport has a major inﬂ uence on the effectiveness of intervention programs. Speciﬁ cally, attitudes and behaviors or historical biases within the sport may prove to be either incentives or barriers to effective implementation of injury prevention programs. To build on our earlier example, the move to man- date full facial protection in adolescent ice hockey was initially resisted due to concerns from sport administrators that the nature of the game would be altered, and from medical personnel that such changes could lead to an increase in neck injuries. Therefore, the development of injury preven- tion programs must take into consideration more than the biomechanics of injury or their speciﬁ c"}

Most of us have insurance in case something goes wrong. Many people who play sport will have health insurance or sports injury insurance through their club or association. This is certainly important and will assist in managing the conse- quences of injury, but does not contribute greatly to injury prevention on an individual or team basis. This chapter will describe the components, activities, and strategies required to develop and manage injury risks in a team setting. The “team setting” not only denotes the team of players that run out onto the ﬁ eld. It also includes teams of athletes in individual sports, such as a swimming team or an alpine skiing team, and includes the support team—manager, coach, trainer, physi- otherapist, and doctor. Communication and coor- dination within the support team and between it and the athletes is a requisite feature of risk man- agement in sport. Principles of risk management The principles of risk management applied to the sports setting have been described in detail by Fuller (2007). Risk management is the overall process of identifying, assessing, and controlling risks."}
{"id": "70", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "It can be applied within and across sport in the upper levels of policy and administration, in a team, and by an individual. Injury risks have been identiﬁ ed in most sports. This process is often general, for example, partici- pants in contact sports experience head injuries. Risk assessment is a more formal process of meas- urement and/or estimation of hazards and risks to athletes on a team. This means measuring the inci- dence and severity of injuries, associated injury risk factors, and injury mechanisms, as described in Chapter 2. Risk evaluation involves determin- ing the signiﬁ cance and acceptability of the risks to all stakeholders; including the athletes, the coaches, and the club. Risk control is the process of identifying and implementing methods to control the level of expo- sure to hazards and/or the consequences. There are four options for risk control: eliminate, retain and manage, outsource, and insure. All options could be in play, each addressing a range of risks. In sport, controls are largely restricted to retain and manage, and insure."}

From a team’s per- spective, it might be possible to outsource medical services and management of venues. A sports team could not be outsourced, whereas a cleaning func- tion in a company could be outsourced to contrac- tors. The two choices that are most often faced are either to accept a risk or reduce a risk. Risk accept- ance implies that an informed decision has been made to accept the consequences and/or likelihood of an injury. These risks may be mitigated through insurance, to cover any losses. This approach does allow all stakeholders to continue their program unchanged in the knowledge that their insurance will cover their loss in case of injury, but does not provide much incentive for injury prevention pro- grams. In professional sports many clubs approach the injury issue simply by employing extra players for each position when injuries occur, which repre- sents another form of risk acceptance. Although participants may appear to accept the level of risk associated with a sport, this is often the result of ignorance of the actual levels of risk involved. This is clearly an important issue, because it is difﬁ cult for a participant to accept risks about which they have no knowledge."}
{"id": "73", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "In most cases, acceptable levels of risk in sport are determined more by the risk perceptions of the participants than by actual data on the risks involved. Another difﬁ culty lies in the fact that, in contrast to other occupations, there are no accepted standards to which risks can be compared. Risk reduction, on the other hand, involves devel- oping and applying methods to prevent injuries and/or reduce their consequences. In addition to the obvious beneﬁ ts to the individual athlete, there is also a ﬁ nancial incentive for sports teams through reduced insurance costs and less need to employ extra players. In recreational and youth sports, risk reduction approaches may assist in maintaining or developing the sport’s viability through retaining ﬁ t participants and promoting the sport as being safe. Risk identiﬁ cation and assessment The establishment of a risk management program in a team setting might be driven from the top or from the grass roots. The ﬁ rst task is to identify the injury risks in the sport and bring these to the attention of the team in its various shapes and sizes. In many sports there is already a strong rec- ognition of injury risks. Simply having good on- and off-ﬁ eld medical treatment and rehabilitation is not injury risk management. The basic steps that will identify injury risks include: • reviewing injury reports from at least one season; • reviewing player turnover and availability within one or more seasons; • reviewing the literature on injury risks in the speciﬁ c sport."}
{"id": "74", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "The person or group who identiﬁ es the risks may then need to be advocates within the team or club for risk assessment and control. This will ide- ally form the basis of a risk management program that is adopted and managed by the club or team. As mentioned earlier, risk assessment is the for- mal process of measuring hazards and risks and reviewing these. It may be necessary to undertake prospective studies of injury rates, patterns, and potential risk factors within a team. Some of the major sports have developed guidelines for injury surveillance. Several leagues, such as the National Hockey League, have established systems where every patient’s record recorded by the medical team is linked to a central database. In this way the league can monitor injury trends and every team can assess their own injury rates and compare them- selves to the league average. Other examples are the International Skiing Federation (FIS), which has established an injury surveillance system to record all injuries during their World Cup; the FIS Injury Surveillance System (FIS ISS); and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which developed its injury surveillance system in 1982 to provide current and reliable data on injury trends in US intercollegiate athletics. Injury and exposure data are collected yearly from a representative sam- ple of NCAA member institutions and the resulting data summaries are reviewed by the NCAA Sport Rules Committees and by the NCAA Committee on Competitive Safeguards and Medical Aspects of Sports. The web-based system also allows individual schools to have a real-time electronic injury record of their speciﬁ c injuries."}

A key element is that injury surveillance is a continuing process. Not only are there seasonal changes, but injury data may assist in identifying the level of success of injury prevention strategies. A formal survey, perhaps using a questionnaire or interview, of the player cohort might also be helpful in assessing risks and provide results with- out the need to wait for one year. As discussed in Chapter 2, there may also be a number of risk fac- tors, internal and external, that should be assessed (Figure 2.2). Risk control: injury prevention Once there is a clear understanding of hazards and risks, and preferably a quantiﬁ able level of risk, decisions are required about interventions to control those risks. Many controls exist and there is a continuous development of new methods. The difﬁ culty faced by many is gaining access to this information and staying abreast of the develop- ments; it is time consuming and often highly tech- nical. Often the existence of effective controls, for example, breakaway bases in softball and baseball, take many years to be recognized and adopted. The “hierarchy of controls” (Figure 3.1) should be followed, but it is recognized that in sport, engi- neering controls might be difﬁ cult to apply."}
{"id": "77", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "The hierarchy is in the descending order of effective- ness: elimination, substitution, engineering con- trols, administrative controls, training, and personal protective equipment.

Let’s consider a pole on a ski run that serves the function of supporting a video camera that provides an important view of the skier. A pole is a collision hazard in a high kinetic energy sport.

The pole could be eliminated and a camera far removed from the ski run installed with lenses to substitute for the proximity. The pole could be substituted by a crane or wires that suspend the camera at the site. An engineering solu- tion might be to manufacture a frangible pole that breaks away during a collision at a force lower than that which would cause injury. Administrative pro- cedures could be implemented to determine where poles could be placed and a process for inspecting the ski run adopted. The skier could be offered per- sonal protective equipment, for example, a helmet and a padded suit, to protect the skier if collision occurs. An additional administrative control would be to mandate the use of that equipment. Finally, the skier could be trained not to collide with poles while skiing competitively. However, we know that even the most skillful athletes err. Sport has often restricted itself to the less effec- tive controls—personal protective equipment, train- ing individual and team skills plus ﬁ tness, and rules."}
{"id": "79", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "It may also be difﬁ cult to implement controls on a team basis because rules of the game, including those that govern protective equipment use and infrastruc- ture, are determined at a national or international level. Disagreements might arise within a compe- tition if, for example, a team decided to prepare its home ground to be slow in order to reduce injury. Another way of looking at hazards, risks, and con- trols is through the injury prevention matrix, where injury prevention methods (related to host, agent, physical environment, and social environment) are categorized based on their ability to prevent accidents altogether (pre-crash), to prevent injury even when there is an accident (crash), or prevent disability even when there is an injury (post-crash) (Table 2.2). This approach has been described in more detail in Chapter 2. Clearly training of the support staff’s response to a serious injury will assist post injury, as will provision of vehicle access to the ground (post-crash). Whereas, team skill training will hopefully prevent unintentional impacts between players within a team (precrash). Improving personal protective equipment function will assist in preventing the injury (decreasing the risk) during the event (crash). Administrative con- trols that mandate PPE and education are preevent interventions. Reaching agreement Agreement on injury prevention within the team, between teams and within a competition is impor- tant. Agreed objectives for the season might be a 30% reduction in lost time injuries or 100% compliance with equipment use protocols, or return to play guidelines."}

Access to team physicians, physical therapists, athletic trainers, and other health professionals is mainly available at the elite and professional lev- els of sport. Nevertheless, many of the risk man- agement functions listed earlier can be performed by coaching staff, parents, or the athlete. Note that there are privacy issues related to management of individual injury/medical infor- mation. There is a need for strong trusting rela- tionships within the team. Guidelines are available which deﬁ ne appropriate lines of communication so that medical staff can maintain a conﬁ dential relationship with a player, but still provide perti- nent information to team management (Anon., 2000). Developing an injury surveillance program within the team Risk management is based on continuous risk assessment. To assess risk within a team, it is necessary to establish a system to monitor inju- ries and exposure. For medical staff, recording injuries should represent one of the easiest tasks in risk management; they are required to keep accurate records of all assessments and treat- ment provided to their patients."}
{"id": "82", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Thus, establish- ing a surveillance system only involves analyzing information that is already there. To make this task even easier, excellent electronic tools are available, where the necessary statistical tools have been integrated in software which helps to maintain patient’s records. Nevertheless, even at the highest levels of sport, this is rarely done on a routine basis. Another task is to establish a system to record individual training and competition exposure within the team. This represents a challenge for the medical team, since they are not always present during practices or on road trips, and therefore this task is often done by the coaching staff. Many of the injury recording software pro- grams also have the capability of recording expo- sure data, which can then be entered based on the coaching records. Exposure data is necessary to calculate risk as described in Chapter 2, and the standard method for calculating injury incidence rates is the number of injuries per 1000 hours of exposure, which is typically used in football codes. For some sports and speciﬁ c player posi- tions, for example, a pitcher or a bowler, injuries per balls delivered may be a more powerful meas- ure from the perspective of identifying relation- ships between injury and exposure. It may also be relevant to record exposure in relation to exter- nal risk factors, such as turf type (e.g. training on grass, gravel, artiﬁ cial turf), use of personal protec- tive equipment, and whether the exposure is dur- ing competition or training. Interpretation of injury data is difﬁ cult unless exposure data are collected."}
{"id": "83", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Consider the exam- ple where there is an increase in the number of match injuries from one season to the next. If the number of matches increases by 30%, there would be no increase in injury incidence. If no medical team is available, it is still possi- ble to develop useable systems to record valuable injury information. In its simplest form, the coach or assistant coach could keep attendance records and simply note absences due to injury through- out the season (and the injury type in question). At the end of the season, the coaching staff would then be able to calculate the number of injuries and the number of days of absence attributable to injury, as well as the main descriptors of injury. As described in Chapter 2, injury risk is not just a question of injury incidence. The severity of injury must also be taken into account, and most often severity is expressed as the number of days of absence from sports because of an injury. Based on this, the total injury risk to a team can be cal- culated as the product of injury incidence and injury severity. This is shown in Table 3.1, using"}

This example shows that in terms of risk, thigh hematomas rep- resent much less of a concern than anterior cruci- ate ligament injuries do, even if they are 16 times more common!Injury data can also be illustrated by a risk matrix that highlights risks in terms of likelihood and consequences. This is an appropriate and powerful tool for presenting injury risk data. The example shown in Figure 3.2 is derived from rugby union. It suggests that injury reductions in the areas of shoulder dislocation and knee ligament injury are priorities, as it is in spinal cord injury prevention. By examining factors that contribute to the cau- sation of shoulder and knee injuries, strategies to reduce injury rates can be formulated. At the highest levels of play, teams may even want to monitor injury mechanisms using match tapes. In professional sports, ﬁ rst-class video recordings are available from all matches and sophisticated software has been developed to ana- lyze play-by-play performance of players. This represents an opportunity to index and analyze all injury situations, as well."}
{"id": "85", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Such analyses may reveal whether there are certain situations with a high propensity for injury, or improper technique or inadequate tactical responses on the part of the injured athlete. Even if more sophisticated analy- sis of the inciting event is laborious, and perhaps better left to scientists, it is possible that large pro- fessional teams can develop their own expertise in understanding the injury mechanisms involved. This information may be used to improve coach- ing and individual player skills. At the community level these expensive resources are absent. When assessing data from injury surveillance, it is important to recognize that within a team, it is very unlikely that a sufﬁ ciently large sample size exists through which the beneﬁ t of a sin- gle or multiple interventions can be assessed. Therefore, “success” or “failure” in few individuals should not be considered justiﬁ cation for a com- plete overhaul of the team’s training and injury prevention programs. In the same way, seasonal variation in sports injury may simply be due to chance. Often the media report a number of simi- lar catastrophic sports injuries over a period of a few weeks which gives the impression that a prob- lem is out of control.

Although health care personnel responsible for teams or training groups may have to initiate this type of analysis, it is strongly recommended that the process is done in collaboration with the coaching team and, if at all possible, the athletes. Professional contracts deal with athlete availabil- ity and player associations to advocate maximum levels of competition and schedules. The inclusion of coaches and athletes will enable them to draw on their past experiences with the team, which is especially important if there are no injury surveil- lance data available from the past. If injury sur- veillance data are available, the season analysis is an opportunity to review formally the past experi- ences and discuss whether the injury patterns seen may be related to the training and competition program. For example, a surge in stress fractures on a soccer team may be attributed to a simulta- neous increase in the volume of running and a change from a soft to a hard running surface. Due to the multi-factorial nature of injury causation in sport, identifying risks in sports programs—over a season or during a tourna- ment—is complicated. In other words, season analysis represents an attempt to predict what may happen—and as such, a form of guess- work. Nevertheless, through discussions between coaches, athletes, and medical staff, it is possible to recognize when athletes are at the greatest risk of sustaining injuries as a result of the training or competitive programs. Examples of situations in which injury risk is higher are when athletes switch from one training surface to another (e.g., from grass to gravel) or to new types of training (e.g., at the start of a strength training period)."}

This type of analysis may be particularly impor- tant to avoid overuse injuries. The analysis is based on the idea that the risk of injuries is greater during transitional periods and that each stage has certain characteristics that may increase risk. The risk proﬁ le usually varies from sport to sport, which underlines how important it is for a medi- cal staff to be intimately familiar with the charac- teristics of the sport they cover. Based on the principles of risk management, once a particular element in the team’s program has been identiﬁ ed to represent a high risk for injury there are two possible solutions: (i) risk acceptance and (ii) risk mitigation. The coaching staff may decide that this particular element is unavoidable, critically important to the success of the team, and therefore must be accepted. However, this is not a decision that should be taken without those at risk, that is the athletes. If a high risk is identiﬁ ed, the coaches should not decide to accept it on behalf of the players (or anyone) without appropriate con- sultation. Preferably, it may be possible to reduce risk, for example, by a more gradual change in run- ning surface than was originally planned. Preseason screening: the preparticipation or annual examination An obvious responsibility of the medical team is the medical screening of athletes."}
{"id": "92", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Preseason or preparticipation examinations are routinely done on hundreds of thousands of athletes around the world every year, in some cases required by sports regulations, or even by law. However, the value of doing routine physical exams on athletes is ques- tionable. If done properly, they can represent a key ingredient in the risk management program of the team. If they are done simply to clear athletes for participation, their value in injury prevention is limited. Unfortunately, this is commonly the case. Preseason examinations are done for a variety of reasons other than to prevent injuries. Most are done for medico-legal reasons; to ensure that the participant is healthy. In other words, the objective is to clear the athlete for participation and verify that there is no sign of injury or illness which would represent a potential medical risk to the athlete (and risk of liability to the sports organization). There are also special cases, for example, when professional teams trade players, where the purpose of the medi- cal screening exam is to protect their investment. It follows from this that the general screening examination may include a number of different conditions, such as: • Musculoskeletal injuries • Cardiovascular disease and risk • Asthma and pulmonary function • Eating disorders • Cognitive deﬁ cits related to mild traumatic brain injury."}
{"id": "93", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "The factors included in the general screening examination can be tailored to the sport in ques- tion, by focusing on conditions known to be partic- ularly prevalent (e.g., low back problems in rowers, eating disorders among female gymnasts, pulmo- nary function among cross-country skiers) or where the physical requirements of the sport implies a higher risk of certain conditions (e.g., Marfan’s syn- drome among basketball or volleyball players). Depending on the sport and, consequently, the proﬁ le of the conditions of interest, screening examinations may involve: • Examination by a medical practitioner or specialist • Examination by a physiotherapist or trainer • Completion of surveys or validated question- naires regarding the psychology of the player, injury history, expectations, and issues • Assessment of nutrition and diet • Neuropsychological assessments • Assessment of individual and team skills by coaching staff • Self-reporting of performance deﬁ ciencies by players • Family history, for example diabetes, cardiac disease, and depression.24 Chapter 3"}
{"id": "94", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Developing and managing an injury prevention program within the team 25 However, if the purpose is to prevent injuries, the value of doing routine examinations alone is lim- ited. For screening exams to serve a purpose in risk management there are some additional require- ments. First, the exam must be designed to iden- tify athletes with risk factors relevant to the sport in question. Second, there must be a plan to follow up athletes with measures intended to reduce risk, if risk factors are identiﬁ ed. Third, the screening exam and follow-up must be planned and led by the medical and coaching staff of the team. Let us consider each of these requirements in turn. The ﬁ rst requirement, that the exam is designed to identify athletes with risk factors relevant to the sport in question, is rarely met in current practice. In fact, in most cases, the same screening exam is used across sports. This is inappropriate. There can be no single recipe for all sports, as injury patterns and risk factors differ signiﬁ cantly."}
{"id": "95", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "In the follow- ing chapters, Chapters 4 through 11, the incidence of the most important injury types across sports are described. The same chapters also describe the main risk factors for each of these injury types. To design a screening program for one particular sport, it is, therefore, necessary to deﬁ ne the key injury types (based on data from the literature on incidence and severity and preferably also surveil- lance data as described earlier), and then to deﬁ ne the key risk factors (for these injuries). Based on this information, the screening exam can be tai- lored to the sport. Even if the key risk factors have been deﬁ ned, a key task remains; to select appropriate methods to screen for these risk factors. Screening methods should be valid, accurate, sensitive, and speciﬁ c. Valid means that the testing method measures the factor you wish to measure. For example, if low hamstrings strength is a risk factor for muscle strains, what method should be used to measure this best?The test is accurate (reliable) means that it will yield the same result each time. A testing method with high sensitivity will identify all play- ers with that factor. A test with high speciﬁ city will identify only players with that factor."}
{"id": "96", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "If the sensitivity is poor then an injured player might be permitted to participate in competition, and if spe- ciﬁ city is poor then a ﬁ t player might be excluded from the competition. Finding valid and accurate tests to measure relevant risk factors with adequate sensitivity and speciﬁ city can be difﬁ cult. The second requirement is that if the presence of a known injury risk factor is identiﬁ ed, an appropriate course of action can be taken to con- trol the risk. If strength is inadequate, it should be followed up with a strength training program. If balance is poor, a training program should be designed and implemented to rectify this. This might be on an individual level, but could be at a team level too. The presence of common risk factors across the team might point to failures in player selection and management, or medical/ rehabilitation management. The third requirement is that the medical and coaching staff of the team must be intimately involved in the screening exam and follow-up of the results. In community level sport, it may be tempting for a club or school to enlist the assist- ance of local sports medicine personnel to screen their athletes. This is only advisable if they can establish a mechanism to communicate the results to the team, and there are resources to follow up athletes with risk factors."}

Monitoring “at risk” team members or team, for example ﬁ tness, technique, and behavior The screening of all players preseason may ﬂ ow into within season monitoring of a subset of “at- risk” players. The questions that will be answered by this screening include: Are players ﬁ t to resume normal local competition following representative competition or international travel?Has a player recovered physical capacity following resolution of a medical condition; is a player returning too early following injury or masking symptoms to continue playing?Is there improvement in a play- er’s technique following identiﬁ cation of a deﬁ cit and a training program?If the preseason screening identiﬁ ed a player with a history of inappropri- ate on- and/or off-ﬁ eld behavior, have appropri- ate steps been taken and are there changes?Is the athlete attending rehabilitation sessions?Is the athlete wearing the speciﬁ c item of protective"}

The same principles apply here, as with preseason monitor- ing; the measures need to be valid and reliable, and intervention and follow-up is required. Return to play following injury The captain of the Australian cricket team responded to a media inquiry as to whether a spe- ciﬁ c player was returning to a competition too early following injury by saying that the player was ﬁ t, that the team did not wish to ﬁ eld an unﬁ t player as he would be less competitive, and the player did not wish to hurt his chances of further selection by playing poorly due to injury. It is clear that it is in the team’s interest for all members to be ﬁ t prior to their complete return to competi- tion. The team, in its broad context, can foster a culture whereby safety is paramount. A player will clearly perform to their best and over a longer time (seasons) if injuries are managed well. The team can let it be known that players’ positions in the team are not in jeopardy while they are recov- ering from injury. Unfortunately, this is often not the case. Supervised injury management programs are very helpful, and can be established even at the community and youth levels where resources are limited. A recent study from Swedish amateur soc- cer illustrated this (Hägglund et al.,"}
{"id": "99", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "2007). Their program was implemented by team coaches and consisted of information about risk factors for rein- jury, rehabilitation principles, and a 10-step pro- gressive rehabilitation program including return to play criteria. An analysis of their data showed a 66% reduction in reinjury rate in the intervention group compared to a control group for all injury locations and a 75% for lower limb injuries. The 10-step rehabilitation program was intended to serve as a guide for the coaches with structured assessment during the functional rehabilitation of players and to assist in return to play decisions. Although the program was designed primarily for lower extremity injuries, coaches were instructed to use it for all injuries. The program was intro- duced to injured players when they were able to walk without limping and without pain. The program contained various exercises with a gradually increased load. Progress through the program was allowed when the player was able to comply with the exercises without pain and swell- ing at the injured site. If a player experienced pain or swelling, he returned to the previous symp- tom-free level and resumed the progress at a later session. No speciﬁ c time limit or number of repeti- tions were set for the progress, but coaches were instructed to evaluate symptoms both when exer- cises were performed as well as the day after."}
{"id": "100", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "The ﬁ nal step was return to competitive play, and an injured player was not eligible for ﬁ rst team selec- tion until he had been able to participate fully in team training without pain and swelling at the injured body site. The required number of pre- match training sessions varied based on the sever- ity of the injury. This study illustrated that it is possible to estab- lish programs to guide return-to-play decisions in a structured manner, and that such programs are beneﬁ cial in preventing reinjury. At lower levels of play, building relationships with the local doc- tors and physiotherapists can assist in establish- ing injury management systems, but this requires more than just providing easy access for injury assessments and emergency care. Speciﬁ c guidelines for return to play are being published, challenged, and revised continuously. In the area of mild traumatic brain injury, where there remains controversy over the “right” time to return to play, the process of making that decision is evidence-based (McCrory et al.,2005). Similar evidence-based guidelines are being developed for other injury types. Education regarding injury management and prevention Educating the team, including the medical and coaching staff, regarding injury management and prevention is necessary. This will at least raise awareness of speciﬁ c topics, such as symptoms that might be related to concussion, and may assist in compliance with injury management and injury prevention programs."}

The rules may have been changed since last season or substantial changes made in equipment and facilities, the background to these changes and the implications for the team can be presented. During the season, opportunities arise in team meetings to present updates and remind- ers on relevant topics. The need may arise to run education sessions within season prior to embark- ing on an international tour or before a tourna- ment. All the activities described here and in other sections of this chapter assist in developing a safety culture in the team. Identiﬁ cation of emergency management requirements Emergency management is an integral part of risk management. Emergency management can- not prevent the initial injury, but it can prevent subsequent injury and reduce the level of impair- ment. There are some very good documents on emergency planning and management in sport (see Chapter 14 for details on coverage for large events). The ﬁ rst step is to identify the team’s requirements."}
{"id": "103", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Again, injury surveillance and risk assessments will identify the nature and extent of the emergency management responses required. Common emergencies are spinal injury, head injury, heat stress, and cardiopulmonary disease. The appropriate level of specialist medical care required at the venue for large events is discussed in Chapter 14. For smaller events it may be appro- priate to ask whether the injury risk is greater than in day-to-day living. While there might be a risk of spinal injury or heart attack in a junior tennis tour- nament, it is probably not necessary to have spe- cialist care on-site. A level of medical coverage and a plan for obtaining specialist care if necessary is required; that is, a list of phone numbers for ambu- lances and local doctors. In contrast, in all contact sports, high velocity sports, and martial arts, the risk of head and spinal injury is sufﬁ cient to war- rant making emergency equipment easily available, for example, to immobilize and transport athletes, and possibly the presence of a trained emergency physician over and above the basic level of medical support required by the team or teams at the event. The emergency management plan will address peo- ple, equipment, and processes. Training and prac- tice are essential for the successful implementation of an emergency management plan. Coordination of injury risk management All the activities described in this section could be bundled together into a safety management sys- tem."}
{"id": "104", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "This requires coordination and planning. The system can also be audited for compliance and completeness. The process requires: 1.

Equipment and facilities International and national standards for equipment and facilities There are numerous national, international, and sport speciﬁ c equipment and facility standards and guidelines. Examples are: • Helmets: National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCASE); Canadian Standards Association (CSA); American National Standards Institute (ANSI), Snell Foundation; Standards Australia (SA); and International Standards Organisation (ISO) • Playing surfaces: ASTM International and the International Association for Sports Surfaces Science • Shin guards: NOCSAE • Gymnastics facilities and crash mat characteristics—the Federation Internationale de Gymnastique Research shows that there are differences in the performance of equipment that meets the same standard. The reality is that equipment stand- ards set minimum performance requirements and some products might just meet these, while others exceed the requirements and offer more protection to the user. There may also be no requirement in a country that a speciﬁ c piece of equipment meets a relevant standard to be offered for sale. Where possible, a team should seek further information prior to deciding on equipment. The team or club is in a much better position to inquire about this than an individual and should advise the athletes or their families accordingly. In youth and community team sport deleterious situations arise with equipment when the “one size ﬁ ts all” approach is taken. Sizing and good ﬁ t are very important. Therefore, the team kit should contain equipment that covers the sizing require- ments of the whole team."}
{"id": "107", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Surprisingly, standards do not exist for some equipment. There is no standard for padding for goal posts, for example. However, checking whether the padding extends to a sufﬁ cient height on the posts can be done. There are some gaps in facility and equipment speciﬁ cations, for example, the International Ice Hockey Federation provides very clear guidelines and advice regarding the development of an ice hockey arena, but details of what constitutes “protective glass” and “pad- ding” are unclear. The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) provides guidelines regarding size and stiffness of crash mats and equipment design. Behavioral adaptation Behavioral adaptation or risk compensation are terms which have been used to describe a possible change in behavior in an athlete when they use protective equipment. The theory is that the per- son will assess the level of risk and, if they assess that the protective equipment reduces that risk, they will simply undertake more extreme activi- ties to return the risk to a level they are comfort- able with. Whether this theory is true generally or only for some individuals remains unknown and it is controversial. Regardless, athletes should be informed and educated about the injury risks in sport and the known effectiveness and limitations of protective equipment and other controls; as described earlier. The results of studies of the effec- tiveness of sports equipment in preventing injury are being published regularly."}
{"id": "108", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Further, if an athlete appears to become more reckless wearing protec- tive equipment, the coaching staff should moni- tor this and intervene. Ideally athletes should be trained while wearing protective equipment so that they become familiar with the limitations. With some equipment the safety performance can compromise athletic performance. For exam- ple, ideally ski bindings will release at a load less than that fracturing the tibia. If the bindings are set with a very large margin of safety, they may release when a skier is safely executing a success- ful high-speed turn. If the bindings are set not to release easily, the same skier may end up execut- ing the turns successful but during an accident suffer serious lower limb injury.

All members of the broad team are responsible for the equipment and facilities. Certainly it is not possible for a player to re-surface an area, but the player might alert team management to those concerns. The facilities and equipment (ﬁ xed and mobile) can be inspected regularly to identify hazards and compliance with the relevant standards or guide- lines. Damage or wear and tear might create haz- ards for players and ofﬁ cials. A protocol for routine inspection of facilities and equipment should be a part of a risk management plan. Organizations such as FIS provide guidelines for the set up and inspection of facilities used in FIS events. There are also private contractors and technical organi- zations that offer services to measure facility per- formance, for example friction, impact energy attenuation, and thermal properties. Training As stated earlier, it is important that teams are trained to use equipment.

It has been esti- mated that about 25% of all injuries across all sports are ankle injuries (Tik-Pui Fong et al.,2007). Thereby, it is important to have a clear focus on ankle inju- ries, the associated risk factors, as well as the meth- ods of prevention. Ankle injuries can be classiﬁ ed as either acute or chronic, with ligamentous injury by far being the most common acute diagnosis. About 85% of all ankle injuries involve the lateral ankle ligaments, that is, ankle sprains. Chronic injuries are often related to, or sequelae of acute sprains, or overuse syndromes of the surrounding soft tissues. In view of the predominance of ankle sprains, this chapter will focus on ligamentous injuries, in par- ticular lateral ligament injuries. The lateral ankle ligaments are the more impor- tant structures that hold the ankle bones and joint in position. In doing so, these ligaments protect the ankle joint from abnormal movements, especially from excessive twisting, turning, and rolling of the foot."}
{"id": "114", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "It is these movements that cause an ankle sprain, that is, when the foot twists, rolls, or turns beyond its normal motions. This causes the ligaments to stretch beyond their normal range in an abnormal position, leading to overstretching or rupture of one or more lateral ankle ligaments. It is not surprising that particularly contact sports, indoor sports, and sports with a high jump rate have a high incidence rate of ankle sprains (Table 4.1). In volleyball it has even been estimated that half of all acute injuries are ankle sprains. In general an ankle sprain causes an individual to refrain from sports participation at least for 1 day. A side effect of an ankle sprain is the high risk of re-injury to the same ankle, which can result in dis- ability and can lead to chronic pain or instability in 20–50% of these recurrent cases. The relatively high rate of ankle sprains across all sports and the potentially negative consequences of ankle sprains on future sports participation, motivates speciﬁ c attention for preventive measures against this type of injury. Sport-speciﬁ c injury epidemiology: soccer It has been estimated that 50–60% of all sports inju- ries in Europe and, as a result, 3.5–10% of all hospital treated injuries are related to soccer.

In a recent review of high school and collegiate football injuries, the most com- monly injured body sites were the knee and lower leg/ankle/foot. The majority (\u000170%) of lower leg/ ankle/foot injuries were to the ankle (15.2% of all injuries). The most common cause of knee and ankle injury was ligament sprains (53.2% for knee and 88.0% for ankles). Rugby has a larger incidence of head, neck, and spine injuries as well as frac- tures.

Almost 90% of the total injuries occurred in the lower extremity and almost two-thirds of the total injuries occurred in the lower leg, ankle, and foot regions. The most common traumatic injury was a sprain of the ankle and usually occurred during running in forest or uneven ground. Basketball In numerous studies in basketball players, profes- sional and amateur, the lower extremity was most commonly injured; the ankle and sprains as the most common type of injury. The ankle and knee injuries were also the most severe with the greatest time lost from participation.

Most of the injuries occur at the net, with ankle sprains resulting from landing on another player’s foot. Gymnastics Women’s gymnastic injury rates have consistently been among the highest seen across sports. The lower extremity accounts for one-half to two-thirds of all reported injuries in gymnastics. Sprains and strains appear to account for over half of these injuries. Although many reports stress that the ankle is one of the most commonly injured joints in gymnastics, one study comparing gymnasts to age-matched con- trols found that the prevalence of ankle complaints was the same, 27% in both groups. Racquet sports Common racquet sports include tennis, badminton, squash, and racquetball. Although one may associate these activities with upper extremity problems, for example, tennis elbow and wrist pain, from epidemi- ological studies available, the lower extremity is still one of the most common sites of injury. Most pub- lished studies indicate that over 50% of injuries in these sports occur in the lower extremities. Of these, ankle sprains appear to be the most common injury."}

Key risk factors: how to identify athletes at risk Previous ankle ligament sprain Of the many risk factors suggested for lateral ankle ligament sprains (Table 4.2), perhaps the most important is a previous sprain. The rationale for this is that disruption of a ligament compromises an important biomechanical stabilizer of the ankle and creates partial deafferentation that can compromise neuromuscular control of the ankle (Hertel, 2000). Studies of soccer athletes, volleyball athletes, basketball athletes, and military recruits undergoing basic training found that they were all at a twofold risk for lateral ankle ligament injury after suffering a prior ankle injury. It is important to identify these players with previous injury and/ or impaired neuromuscular control, in order to provide proper treatment and medical guidance. Postural sway Postural sway is closely linked to a previous ankle sprain occurrence (Willems et al.,2005a, b). A sprain affects neuromuscular control of the ankle, sub- sequently leading to an increased risk of re-injury. Recognizing that an athlete’s center of gravity con- stantly changes position during upright posture (i.e., postural sway), and that this is under the con- trol of both the central and the peripheral nervous system, many different approaches have been used to characterize postural sway and this outcome appears to be related to the risk of suffering an ankle injury. Postural sway is generally characterized in a practical approach that involves measurements of the duration of time that a subject can maintain a single leg stance without touching down to recover balance."}
{"id": "121", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Athletes, who are able to maintain a sin- gle leg stance for at least 15 s are considered to have normal posture, whereas those that touchdown to regain balance within the 15 s test are considered to have abnormal posture (Figure 4.1). Several studies have shown that athletes with abnormal posture suffer more ankle sprains as compared to athletes with normal sway. Gender Among female athletes, the risk of suffering a ﬁ rst time ankle ligament tear is associated with the sport they participate in. Several studies have shown that the risk of suffering a ﬁ rst time ankle ligament injury appears to be highest for female basketball athletes, who are estimated to have a 25% higher risk than male basketball athletes."}
{"id": "122", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Preventing ankle injuries 33 In contrast, there is evidence that suggests the risk of suffering repeated ankle ligament sprains is sim- ilar for females and males for jumping sports such as volleyball. Additional research that focuses on the effect of gender on the risk of suffering a ﬁ rst time ankle ligament injury is needed in other high risk sports that produce ankle ligament injuries. Range of motion of the ankle A decrease in dorsiﬂ exion range of motion of the ankle has been associated with an increased risk of suffering an ankle sprain (Willems et al.,2005a, b; de Noronha et al.,2006). The relationship between decreased dorsiﬂ exion and increased risk of ankle ligament injury may be produced by a tight gas- trocnemius muscle–tendon complex, which could place the ankle–foot complex in greater plantar ﬂ exion during activity. This would unlock the talus from the ankle mortise, and place the ankle at an increased risk of abnormal inversion and internal rotation. This ﬁ nding suggests that athletes that are predisposed to ankle ligament injury because of decreased dorsiﬂ exion range of motion may realize some beneﬁ t in terms of reduction of ankle ligament injury risk by participating in stretching programs that are designed to increase dorsiﬂ exion motion. Height and weight Height and weight have been implicated as risk factors because when a athlete is in an at-risk posi- tion for inversion ankle trauma, an increase in either height or weight proportionally increases the magnitude of the inversion torque that must be resisted by the ligaments and muscles that span the ankle complex; however, there is little consen- sus in the literature with regard to how these out- comes are related to risk of ankle ligament injury. There are studies that demonstrated that height and weight are not independent risk factors for ankle sprains."}

{"id": "124", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "34 Chapter 4 Limb dominance Limb dominance has been implicated as a risk factor for lower extremity trauma because most athletes place a greater demand on their dominate limb and as a consequence produce an increased fre- quency and magnitude of moments about the knee and ankle, particularly during high demand activi- ties that place the ankle and knee at risk. However, the literature is divided with regard to limb domi- nance as a risk factor for suffering an ankle liga- ment sprain. Contrasting ﬁ ndings in the literature are most likely produced by different study designs, differences in the sample sizes, the different sports studied, or the methods used for data analysis. Foot type, foot size, and anatomic alignment of the lower extremity Anatomic foot type, when classiﬁ ed as pronated, supinated, or neutral, does not appear to be a risk factor for ankle sprains. It is important to point out that the use of the classiﬁ cation system, which characterizes anatomic foot type as pronated, supi- nated, or neutral, may be inadequate for identify- ing abnormalities in foot biomechanics. Indeed, the deﬁ nitions of different foot types are vague and not scientiﬁ cally based. This approach has not been related to musculoskeletal abnormalities, as it does not have the speciﬁ city and sensitivity to identify abnormalities in foot biomechanics, and it is evalu- ated while a subject is standing barefoot (sometimes in a laboratory) and not during a situation when the lower extremity is at risk for injury. Therefore, speciﬁ c and sensitive measurements of foot contact mechanics that can be used during dynamic, at-risk activity need to be developed and used to deter- mine if they are capable of identifying an ankle at risk for an inversion sprain. Studies revealed that dynamic pes planus, pes cavus, and increased hind foot inversion are associated with an increased risk of suffering a sprain of the lateral ankle ligaments (Morrison & Kaminski, 2007). The same goes for an increased foot width, which can be explained, at least in part, by the fact that during an inversion injury, an increased foot width is associated with an increased moment arm and corresponding inver- sion moment in comparison to a narrow foot."}

However, the literature presents conﬂ icting ﬁ ndings with regard Figure 4.1. Balance test. The patient stands on one leg with the other leg slightly ﬂ exed and hanging straight down.

The discrepancy between the avail- able evidence may derive from the use of the clini- cal examination and a grading system to evaluate joint laxity. Indeed, accurate and reproducible clin- ical examination is not easy. Another reason might be an inadequate sample size with too few subjects with increased ankle laxity included. It is impor- tant to appreciate that increased ankle joint laxity may be highly correlated with prior ankle ligament injury which by itself is an established risk factor for ankle ligament re-injury. From this perspective, if a study includes joint laxity as an outcome, an increase in this outcome may simply serve as a sur- rogate for prior injury. There appears to be a con- sensus in the literature that generalized joint laxity has no predictive value for ankle sprains. This is the case when considering men and women athletes as a group, and men and women as separate groups. Muscle strength While most would consider it intuitive that lower extremity strength is related to the risk of suffer- ing an ankle ligament sprain, only a few investiga- tions have studied this with a prospective design and accurate equipment and there is little consen- sus between the studies. An increased risk of ankle ligament injuries has been observed for collegiate female athletes participating in soccer, ﬁ eld hockey, and lacrosse when they have higher peak torque ratios between the invertors and evertors of the ankle."}

In contrast, a study of male military recruits found no relationship between muscle strength and the likelihood of suffering an ankle ligament injury. Shoe type An extrinsic risk factor, which has been well investi- gated, is the shoe type. Although most would agree that current athletic shoes offer limited support to an ankle in response to inversion trauma, it is impor- tant to recognize that little is known about the effect of athletic shoes and how they are related to ankle injury. Speciﬁ c characteristics of the shoe may either reduce the risk of injury (e.g., certain design charac- teristics may provide increased proprioceptive input) or increase the risk of injury (e.g., restricted ankle range of motion, abnormal foot-shoe, and shoe- surface traction, or increase the inversion moment arm about the ankle complex). There is little infor- mation on the effect that different characteristics of athletic shoes have on the risk of ankle injury. It is more likely that the newness of the shoe plays a more important role than its height in preventing ankle sprains. Play setting There is a general consensus that across all sports the risk of injuries in general is higher during competition than during training. It seems logical to assume that this also goes speciﬁ cally for ankle sprains."}
{"id": "128", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "This logical assumption is backed up by sound evidence from soccer, basketball, as well as volleyball. The main reason for this difference in injury risk lies in different play modes between competition and training. During competition athletes are more prone to take “risks” in order to win. During training, logically, taking risks is minimized and most play consist of short well controlled bouts of sports speciﬁ c drills. In short, the playing environment during training is more controlled and thereby safer. Playing position Volleyball athletes are at increased risk when they play the front row positions, by landing under the net after a jump for a spike or block. However, in sports such as basketball and soccer which also involve jumping, planting, and cutting, the risk of ankle ligament injury appears to be similar between positions. Nevertheless, at least for soccer, it is known that most injuries occur when an athlete has to play outside his or her usual playing position, for example, a striker making a defensive action, or a defensive player moving toward the opponent’s goal. Therefore, while in certain sports ankle sprain risk may not be directly associated with playing position, an athlete at a speciﬁ c playing position"}

Take-home message In recent years considerable research has focused on risk factors related to ankle sprains. This has resulted in a number of potential risk factors, of which most are surrounded by conﬂ icting ﬁ ndings from scientiﬁ c studies. The only well documented, and probably by far strongest risk factor for an ankle sprain, is a history of a previous similar injury, especially an injury during the past year. Therefore, it is important to map previous injury and test pro- prioceptive ankle function by means of a postural sway test. This latter method has been proved to be able to detect athletes at risk. Although preventive measures should be advocated to all athletes, espe- cially this subgroup of previously injured athletes should be targeted with preventive measures, such as proprioceptive training, taping, or bracing. Injury mechanisms for ankle sprains Anatomical and biomechanical aspects Before describing the injury mechanisms leading to an ankle sprain, a short description of the ankle complex is required. The ankle is a so-called hinge joint, bringing the lower leg (tibia and ﬁ bula) and the foot (talus) together. The hinge allows dorsiﬂ ex- ion (pulling the ankle up to make the toes face up) and plantar ﬂ exion (stretching the ankle and make the toes face down)."}
{"id": "130", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "These movements occur in varying degrees between 50º and 90º. The talus is wider in the front, making it a wedge-shaped bone. Due to its shape the talus provides maximum stabil- ity in dorsiﬂ exion but minimal stability in plantar ﬂ exion. Although there is room for some inversion and eversion movement (turning the foot inward or outward respectively), the range of motion of these movements is limited. This limitation in movement is primarily restricted by the capsule surrounding the ankle, which is reinforced by both medial and lateral ligaments. The lateral ligaments, the area of interest here, are the anterior taloﬁ bular ligament, the calcaneoﬁ bular ligament, and the posterior tal- oﬁ bular ligament (Figure 4.2). When sitting with a relaxed ankle, the ankle tends to hang in a slight plantar ﬂ exed inversed position, that is, the toes are slightly facing the ﬂ oor and pointing slightly inward. This is the “neu- tral” position of the ankle. This can also be seen when inspecting worn shoe soles. The initial point of impact is on the outside of the heel, showing in the fastest wear on that side of the sole. What hap- pens is that when walking, in the swing phase the ankle moves to its “neutral” position."}
{"id": "131", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Although this is the “neutral” ankle position, it is also a position that puts the ankle at risk for inversion injuries, that is, ankle sprains. As said, in this ankle position the bony stability provided by talus is low, and most of the laxity restraint is provided by the lateral liga- ments. Although the ankle is in perfect balance in the “neutral” position, a slight interference moving the ankle in to a further plantar ﬂ exed inversion position, results in forces which the lateral liga- ments can’t handle. As a result the ankle forcefully inverts, which is called an ankle sprain (Figure 4.3). An ankle sprain results in physical damage to the lateral ankle ligaments, and is usually classiﬁ ed by the number of ligaments that are injured. With the foot in plantar ﬂ exed inversion, the biggest strain is on the anterior taloﬁ bular ligament. It may not be Anterior talofibular ligament Posterior talofibular ligament Calcaneofibular ligament Figure 4.2. The lateral ankle ligaments"}

With increasing forces, the next ligament to tear is the calcaneoﬁ bular ligament, and in rare cases the posterior ligament is also injured. Based on the mechanism described earlier, it is not surprising that most sports-related ankle sprains are a result of landing on other athletes, objects, or uneven surfaces. Even so, this explains (at least in part) the increased risk after an earlier ankle sprain. As said, a previous ankle sprain results in partial deafferentation that can compromise neuromus- cular control of the ankle, a proprioceptive deﬁ cit. Ankle proprioception is an important regulatory system keeping the ankle in the safe “neutral” posi- tion. When one is unable to accurately detect the position of the ankle, its position will easily deviate from the “neutral” position. Additionally, the pro- tective reﬂ exes reacting to a sudden inversion of the ankle won’t be able to detect changes in range of motion to such an extent that a proper reaction is possible. The term “feel” should be put into context here, since the proprioceptive system is regulated peripherally. In short it is the whole system consist- ing of muscle spindles, nerves, reﬂ exes, etc."}

Examples from speciﬁ c sports One of the sports in which the events leading to an ankle sprain has been well documented, is vol- leyball. Nearly all volleyball-related ankle sprains result from player-to-player contact. Ankle sprains occur most frequently at the net, as the result of contact between the attacker and the opposing blocker(s) across the centerline (Verhagen et al., 2004a). It is well known from several studies that approximately half of all ankle sprains occur when a blocker lands on the foot of an opposing attacker who has legally crossed the centerline. It happens frequently that an attacker getting ready for a spike has to adjust his jump for a set that is too low and too close to the net. The resulting momentum and jump trajectory takes him under the net. As long as part of the attacker’s foot touches the cen- terline this is allowed within the rules of volley- ball. Unfortunately, for tactical reasons the blocker jumps later than the attacker, and may land on the attacker’s foot within this “conﬂ ict zone” under the net."}
{"id": "134", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "This situation accounts for about half of the ankle sprains in volleyball. Additionally, approximately one quarter of all ankle sprains occur when a blocker lands on a teammate’s foot when participating in a multi-person block. Consequently, middle blockers and outside attack- ers are at greatest risk for ankle sprain (net posi- tions), whereas setters and defensive specialists are at comparatively lower risk (back court positions). Although in volleyball ankle sprain risk seems to be position speciﬁ c, in sports such as basketball, soccer, and handball which also involve jumping, planting, and cutting, the risk of ankle ligament injury appears to be similar between positions. In these sports the different skills and tasks between positions do not vary as greatly as in volleyball. More importantly, players are not divided by a net and physical contact and jumping within close range of each other is not uncommon. In soccer, it has been found that ankle sprains occur when the players gets hit in a late, sliding tackle, while the foot is being planted on the surface (Figure 4.4). A laterally directed hit on the medial side of the ankle or lower leg will put the ankle in a vulnerable, supinated position, and when the player puts weight on the ankle, this leads to an inver- sion sprain. In other words, it is not the tackle that ruptures the ligament, but the fact that the tackle causes the player to land in a vulnerable position. In the end a vast amount of sports- and situation-speciﬁ c examples of situations in which ankle sprains occur can be given."}

Identifying risks in the training and competition program Little is known about possible seasonal inﬂ uences on the risk of sustaining an ankle sprain, and the meager evidence shows no strong relationships. This is not completely surprising, while ankle sprains occur most frequently in indoor sports with a high jump rate like volleyball or basketball. For that reason most research focuses on these sports in which weather conditions have no impact on ankle sprain risk whatsoever. However, by using common sense one can think of a number of rea- sons why during autumn and winter ankle sprain risk could be inﬂ uenced by weather conditions. The fact that these relational inﬂ uences have never been described is probably associated with rules prohibiting play on dangerous pitch conditions or athletes being aware of these risks. Although seasonal inﬂ uence may lack a scientiﬁ c basis, in male amateur soccer players it has been shown that most ankle sprains occur during the ﬁ rst 2 months of the season (Kofotolis et al.,2007). This is in line with ﬁ ndings that in males low running speeds and low cardiorespiratory ﬁ tness are associ- ated with ankle sprains (Willems et al.,2005b)."}
{"id": "137", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "After the summer break athletes will be less “ﬁ t,” and the level of ﬁ tness will be regained during the course of the season. Therefore, it is advised to pay special attention to ankle sprains at the start of a new sea- son. This can be done for instance by eliminating all external risk factors, by advocating preventive measure use to all players, or by planning training session aimed more at increasing ﬁ tness than skill. Preventive measures Based on the scientiﬁ c evidence on etiology of ankle sprains and the injury mechanisms described earlier in this chapter, a matrix illustrating poten- tial methods to prevent ankle sprains can be cre- ated (Table 4.3). It should be said that although for a number of potential ankle sprain risk factors there is (shallow) scientiﬁ c evidence, most risk factors can be established by using common sense. Balls may wander around the pitch during training, during the winter time the ﬁ eld is harder and other cleats are required, a wet cross-country running track is slippery, three players jumping for a rebound under the basket, etc. Although general preventive guide- lines based on proven risk factors can be given, each situation is different. Therefore, it is recom- mended to keep track of the ankle sprain causes in an injury log and perform a subsequent risk analy- sis on the acquired data. In this way recurring risks can be ascertained and dealt with accordingly. Rule changes In volleyball most ankle sprains occur under the net when a player lands on the foot of a teammate or an opponent after jumping for a spike or block."}

The current net-line rule allows a player to cross the line under the net as long as part the foot stays in contact with the line. Changing this rule to a state where a player may not cross or touch the net- line, will avoid the possibility to land on an oppo- nent’s foot. Thereby, an important cause of ankle sprains in volleyball will be eliminated. In a pilot study where this suggested rule was applied, it was found that too many rallies were stopped due to violations of this new rule, and the proposed rule change was discarded. Nevertheless, the rule could be applied during practice – both to reduce risk and to teach players techniques to win the ball without entering the potential conﬂ ict zone under the net. Another example of a rule change intended to prevent ankle injuries is from soccer, where tackles from behind result in an automatic red card and expulsion from the game. Recent data suggest that red cards should also be considered for late sliding tackles against the lower leg. It is obviously not always possible to develop effective rule changes that reduce injury risk. However, when keeping track of ankle sprain causes in an injury log one may identify situations where ankle injuries occur more frequently."}

Formal rule changes to avoid risky situations may not possible, because they change the nature of the game as in the previous volleyball example. Still, once established, players can be taught to recognize and avoid risky situations during training. Adjusted rules can be applied during training, one can avoid drills involving risky situations or even design drills to teach avoidance strategies in high-risk situa- tions (provided the drills are done in a safe way, of course). Following the examples giving earlier, after heavy rain cross-country runners should avoid une- ven and slippery surfaces during training. During practice soccer players may be instructed to restrict their dueling on corner kicks. Such measures can drastically decrease overall ankle sprain risk. One can only get injured while participating in sports, and training accounts for the highest exposure. A safe training environment will therefore have a great impact on injury risk.

Improving player skills With regard to high-risk situations in volleyball, a preventive program that included improvement of volleyball skills was evaluated (Bahr et al.,1997). Players were taught speciﬁ c jumping and landing techniques that prevented them to land in the “conﬂ ict zone” under the net. Two seasons later there was a twofold reduction in the incidence of ankle sprains. In addition it was shown that the number of ankle sprains due to player contact in the “conﬂ ict zone” was decreased signiﬁ cantly. Although this example stems from volleyball, this shows that the overall idea to teach players (on how) to avoid risky situations is potentially very effective. Again an injury log may provide the information needed to develop skill training for speciﬁ c sports and speciﬁ c situations."}

Younger athletes have not acquired sports speciﬁ c skills to such an extent. Thereby, it is easier to teach younger players safe skills and to ensure they employ these skills in true sports situations. Taping Probably the most well known and already widely preventive measures against ankle sprains are tape and braces. Review of the prospective studies of the effect of taping and bracing on reduction of ankle sprains reveal a consistent ﬁ nding; athletes with a history of ankle sprains, who regularly use a brace or tape experience a lower incidence of ankle sprains (Quinn et al.,2000). Taping is a form of strapping that attaches tape to the skin in order to physically maintain a cer- tain joint position. Taping of the ankle is the ear- liest prophylactic measure used to prevent ankle sprains. What one also does is stimulate additional nerve receptors on the ankle surface and to avoid any excessive ankle movements leading to an ankle sprain. Over time a large variety of taping methods has been developed."}
{"id": "144", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Additionally, many different types of athletic tapes are manufactured, which can be divided into a non-elastic and elastic variant. For standard ankle application, the choice of tape is 3.8 or 5.1 cm white porous athletic non-elastic tape. The two most commonly used and widely accepted methods are the so-called basketweave method and the ﬁ gure-eight method (Box 4.1). Other taping methods are also available, as well as variations on the methods explained here. Applying tape can be difﬁ cult and, more importantly, frustrat- ing at ﬁ rst. With a bit of practice one will be able to properly tape an ankle within a few minutes. One of the greatest beneﬁ ts of taping is that one can adjust the method of taping to the needs of the athlete. This starts with the preparation of the skin. The most common preparation is to clean and dry the lower leg, ankle, and foot. A layer of pre-wrap is applied to the ankle."}
{"id": "145", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Some athletes prefer to shave the hair around the ankle, and to have the tape applied directly to the skin. Whatever the wishes of the athlete, a quick drying adherent is recommended and may be sprayed onto the skin to allow for better tape adhesion. If wanted, heel and lace pads can be applied to areas of high friction (e.g., the dorsum of the ankle and the distal Achilles tendon) to prevent blisters. Braces The concept of ankle bracing evolved from ankle taping. Braces are currently being used instead of traditional taping by many athletes at all levels of competition. They offer several advantages in that they are self-applied, reusable, and readjustable. In the long run, they are also more cost-effective than taping. A brace will be a one time expense lasting a couple of seasons. Tape is not reusable, and every time new rolls of tape must be pur- chased. Although braces are considered to have important advantages over tape, many athletes do not feel as comfortable or as stable wearing braces, which can be a disadvantage to treatment."}
{"id": "146", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Braces also can become torn or lost and require replace- ment. Additionally, there is a common belief that braces affect performance by restricting too much ankle movement. Although this has never been shown in scientiﬁ c studies, it is for instance likely that the use of an ankle brace alters the (feeling of) ball contact in soccer. Thereby, the advocation of braces in soccer may result in non-compliance, and it would be better to recommend the use of ankle tape. Braces come in three different basic varieties (Box 4.2). These varieties may go by different names, but in general one can speak of the following: 1. Ankle sleeves: These provide no stability but provide compression and can be used for prevention due to their positive proprioceptive (balance and positioning) effect. These braces do not limit normal ranges of motion of the foot and ankle.2. Non-rigid ankle braces: These come in two basic types (a) with an elastic sleeve with “wrap-around” straps, and (b) nylon, canvas, or neoprene lace-up brace with elastic wrap around straps."}

Hold the tape between the thumb and the index ﬁ nger of each hand with little to no gap between the thumbs. Quickly pull the hands in opposite directions to tear off a piece of tape.2. Avoid wrinkles in the tape, these can lead to blisters and discomfort. Once applied the tape will be stuck solid, therefore one must smooth the tape while it is being applied.3. Learn to use the angles naturally supplied by the ankle. When forcing tape in a speciﬁ c direction it does not want to go will create wrinkles and results in a less effective application.4."}

Each area should be covered by two layers of tape. Uncovered areas within the taped ankle lead to blisters.5. Do not use excessive force when applying tape. Constriction of blood ﬂ ow is possible when tape is applied too tightly. The basketweave method Step 1: Wrap one piece of athletic tape under the heel of the foot and bring both ends up the ankle to either side of the leg. The tape should form a “U,” like the stirrup on a horse’s saddle. Step 2: Afﬁ x the tape to the skin just behind the knobby bone that juts out on either side of the ankle, pressing the tape ﬁ rmly along the little groove behind the bone. Step 3: Wrap a second piece of tape around the base of the heel, bringing the ends of the tape along either side of the foot, heading for the toes."}

Step 4: Wrap a third piece of tape under the heel and up either side of the foot and ankle in the same manner as you wrapped the ﬁ rst piece of tape. Position the tape so that it runs adjacent to the ﬁ rst piece of tape—it should fall right over the knobby anklebone that juts out. Step 5: Wrap a fourth piece of tape around the heel, running just above and adjacent to the second piece of tape, with the ends again heading for the toes along both sides of the foot. You now have the basic structure for the “basket weave”—overlapping pieces of tape that wrap around the heel, extend to the toe, wrap under the heel, and climb up to the ankle. Step 6: Apply about eight more pieces of tape in this manner— four adjacent strips of tape that wrap around the heel pointing toward the toes, and four adjacent strips that wrap under the heel and head up the ankle. Alternating between strips that run along the foot and strips that run up the ankle will give you a weave that limits mobility and supports the entire ankle.

Semi-rigid braces: The construction of these braces is similar to the non-rigid versions, but with the added feature of molded plastic struts or air cushions. These are incorporated into the medial and lateral sides of the brace, similar in orientation to the stirrups used in ankle taping. These braces are effective at stabilizing the ankle in inversion (rolling out) and eversion (rolling in) but less effective when the athlete is in a dorsiﬂ exed position (the most common mechanism of ankle sprain), provide more stability and often are chosen during the rehabilitation and return to play phases of ankle injury. Braces versus tape Many studies have been completed comparing tap- ing versus bracing of the ankle to try and determine which is the better method. The general idea behind braces and tape is that both measures prevent exces- sive plantar ﬂ exed inversion when needed. It is known from previous research that in comparison to tape, braces have the best mechanical capabilities in terms of a reduction of ankle range of motion. Although tape appears to have an equal restrict- ing effect directly after application, the mechanical support is already gone after short bouts of exer- cise. Braces do not show such loosening, and can be easily tightened, even during the match.

However, the superior restricting effect of braces does not translate to a superior preventive effect. Both tape and braces seem equally effective for the prevention of recurrent ankle sprains. Both meas- ures have the effect to prevent ankle sprain recur- rences and have less effect in “healthy” subjects, and in “healthy athletes” ankle sprains cannot be prevented using braces or tape. The preventive effect of these measures does not result from a restriction in ankle range of motion only. A common belief is that external ankles sup- ports prevent ankle sprains by affecting (or support- ing) ankle proprioception instead of by restricting ankle inversion, or simply help guide the foot during landing to avoid landing in a vulnerable, inverted position. This also explains the inability to help players without previous ankle sprains, since healthy ankles have normal proprioception and do not have a tendency to land in an awkward foot position. Balance training One measure that has been studied extensively in the recent years is improvement of neuromuscular function, and more speciﬁ cally balance board (pro- prioceptive) training. Trauma to mechanoreceptors of the ankle ligaments after an ankle sprain can pro- duce a proprioceptive impairment in the ankle. This might explain the increased risk of re-injury within 1 year after an ankle sprain."}

This potential effect has been shown in studies in a variety of different sports, all showing an injury risk reduction for players with previous ankle sprains (Tropp et al.,1985; Verhagen et al.,2004b). A basic proprioceptive training program is described in Box 4.3.

Instead, it will review the epidemiology of one of the most serious knee inju- ries experienced during participation in Olympic Sports; disruption of the anterior cruciate liga- ment (ACL). This injury is not the most common ligament injury experienced in sports. However, as described below it is one of the most serious in terms of absence from sport, pain, disability, and an increased risk of development of osteoarthritis about the knee joint. In Olympic summer sports, the high- est ACL injury incidences occur during participation in basketball, soccer, and team handball. The highest injury risk is among top level female athletes who compete in team handball and soccer (Table 5.1). A gender difference is very apparent in ball sports, where female athletes suffer ACL injuries 4–6 times more often than their male counterparts taking part in the same sports at the same level of competition (Table 5.1). The injury mechanism is frequently the “non-contact” type which means that there is limited contact between the opponent and the athlete about the lower extremity immedi- ately before and during the injury. In many situa- tions, athletes are perturbed just before the injury occurs, and the injury is often incited by a push from an opponent. The inciting moment of the injury often surprises the players since they are performing movements that they have done many times in the past."}
{"id": "177", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Among the Olympic winter sports, ACL injuries are most the common in the sport of alpine ski- ing. Alpine ski injuries are typically reported as the number of ACL injuries per 100,000 skier days (Table 5.1) and, therefore, a comparison of these data with that from other sports cannot be made in a direct manner. The injury often occurs during high speed situations with considerable magnitudes of forces and torques produced across the ath- lete’s knee. The new Olympic sport of snowboard- ing includes the different disciplines of “big air,” “snowboard cross,” “half pipe,” and “slalom.”Most consider these sports to be associated with high numbers of knee injuries; however, precise injury data are currently not available. This is a sport that is under development and therefore we must fol- low it closely and carry out prospective studies to record the incidence rates of knee and ACL injuries. There is no consistent data regarding sex differ- ences in recreational alpine skiers; however, female competitive alpine skiers have twice the incidence rate of ACL injuries in comparison to male compet- itive alpine ski racers. In the sport of ice hockey the incidence of ACL injuries is low; however, a greater number of medial collateral ligament (MCL) inju- ries are seen as a result of a direct blow to the lateral aspects of the knee by an opponent. MCL injuries are also common in soccer, often with the same injury mechanism as in ice hockey. Sports Injury Prevention, 1st edition."}

Studies of European team handball ath- letes have shown that the relative risk of sustaining an ACL injury is approximately 30 times greater during competition than during training. This dif- ference is expected, since the intensity and corre- sponding loads transmitted to the knee and ACL are higher during competition when compared to training sessions. In most sports, training sessions include warm-up exercises and technical drills, which are associated with a lower risk of injury. ACL injury has received great attention even though it is not the most frequent injury suf- fered during participation in sports. The primary reason for this is the severity of the injury: For most athletes involved with Olympic sports, sur- gery is necessary to return them to their sport at the same level of competition they were capable of prior to injury and rehabilitation and recovery requires a long absence from sport. A recovery time that ranges between 6 and 12 months is not unusual. Studies have shown that the long-term risk of suffering premature osteoarthritis is con- siderably greater among ACL injured athletes in comparison with athletes who do not suffer these severe injuries. This results in substantial direct and indirect treatment costs in relation to medical disability. Osteoarthritis occurs, at a rate that is 10 times greater, for athletes who suffer an ACL injury regardless of whether they choose reconstructive surgery or non-operative treatment."}

{"id": "181", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Preventing knee injuries 51 majority of this work has focused on ACL injuries. However, there remains a signiﬁ cant knowledge gap concerning the risk factors for serious knee injuries such as an ACL disruption. This is because only a few well-designed prospective studies are available and most studies have assessed only one factor in isolation. Considering that the risk fac- tors for ACL injury are multifactorial (e.g., mul- tiple risk factors act in combination to increase an athlete’s risk of suffering an ACL injury), this approach is not appropriate to assess how risk fac- tors act in combination to increase an individu- al’s risk of suffering a severe knee ligament injury. Further, the majority of these studies have identi- ﬁ ed sex differences in anatomy as well as hormo- nal and neuromuscular function; however, they fail to relate these differences to the risk of suffer- ing a severe knee ligament injury (Table 5.2). External risk factors: shoe–surface interaction The shoe–surface interaction has been studied as an ACL injury risk factor in different sports. A study of Australian football athletes has reported that the risk of sustaining non-contact ACL inju- ries increased during high-evaporation and low- rainfall periods. Studies of soccer athletes reported that competing on artiﬁ cial turf does not increase the risk of knee injuries compared with natural grass. In contrast, recent studies of professional American football athletes suggest that the inci- dence of ACL injuries may be greater on the new artiﬁ cial turf designs in comparison with the older turf designs. In the sport of European team hand- ball, it was shown that the risk of ACL injury was 2.4 times greater when competing on artiﬁ cial ﬂ oors (with an increased coefﬁ cient of friction) compared with wooden ﬂ oors."}
{"id": "182", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Earlier studies of American football athletes have shown that the use of longer cleat lengths and an associated higher torsional resistance at the foot–turf inter- face places these athletes at an increased risk of suffering knee injuries. There is little doubt that the shoe–playing surface interface is important to consider when developing intervention strate- gies to reduce the incidence rate of serious knee injuries. Internal risk factors: previous knee injury Recent studies have suggested that having a pre- vious injury may be a risk factor for subsequent injury—either a rupture of the ACL graft, an ACL rupture to the contralateral knee, or another type of acute or overuse knee injury. One study also showed that females experience ACL re-rupture at a rate twice that of men. Age Although there appears to be a consensus that the risk of suffering an ACL injury increases for female athletes during their growth spurt, there are no investigations that have included age as a potential risk factor in analysis of serious knee injuries in skel- etally mature athletes. Similarly, no investigations of the effect of age on the likelihood of suffering a knee injury in skeletally immature athletes exist. Body composition An increased body mass index (BMI) has been found to be associated with an increased risk of suffering ACL injuries in female cadets attending the US Military academy. However, other studies have not found such a relationship. The data on BMI appear to be inconsistent, making it difﬁ cult to establish reliable conclusions.

One cause could be that a narrower femoral notch is associated with a smaller, weaker ACL. This hypothesis has been challenged by recent studies that used MRI to cor- relate the size of the ACL with the size of the inter- condylar notch. These studies suggest that the size of the ACL cannot be predicted by the size of the femoral intercondylar notch. Another possibility is that impingement of the ACL against the femo- ral intercondylar notch may be more predominant when the notch is narrow and this may induce microtears of the ligament during participation in athletics that subsequently progress to mac- rotears that weaken the ligament and predispose it to an increased risk of a complete tear. Research is needed to delineate the role of notch impinge- ment as an ACL injury risk factor. Three prospec- tive cohort studies, as well as several other lesser quality studies, have found that athletes with a decreased femoral notch width are at an increased risk of suffering an ACL injury. There are, however, several studies that do not show such an associa- tion and as a consequence it remains unclear how notch width geometry, or notch width index, is related to increased risk of suffering an ACL injury. Ligament material properties and joint laxity The size and material properties of the ACL are factors that may inﬂ uence the risk of this ligament tearing. It has been shown that ACLs in females are smaller than in males when normalized for body weight."}
{"id": "193", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "In addition, it has been reported that female ligaments have lower strain and strain energy density at failure as well as 22.5% lower modulus of elasticity. However, at the curren point in time, no risk factor studies have consid- ered these variables. On the other hand, there are studies that have established increased anterior knee laxity as a risk factor for females, and this may be a result of differences in the size and mate- rial properties of the ACL. It is important for us to point out that these studies are relatively small and such factors can only explain a relatively small proportion of the variance in ACL injury risk. Generalized joint and ligament laxity have also been proposed as risk factors for knee liga- ment injuries; however, most of these studies have evaluated the effect of these variables on all lower extremity injuries as a group and not knee liga- ment injuries in isolation. A few exceptions exist and these studies suggest that increased general- ized joint laxity and increased hyperextension of the knee may be associated with increased risk of suffering an ACL injury. Foot pronation It has been suggested that foot pronation may lead to anterior tibial translation, and subsequently strain the ACL; however, the results are conﬂ ict- ing. Three case-control studies found a relationship between foot pronation/navicular drop and ACL injuries whereas one found no such relationship. Hormonal factors To determine how different phases of the men- strual cycle affect ACL injury risk, it appears nec- essary to accurately describe the hormone milieu with serum- or urine-based measures of hormone concentrations and then use these data to accu- rately identify the phase of the cycle when injury occurs. The use of an athlete’s self-report of men- strual history is inadequate to determine the phase of cycle at the time of injury."}

The patella tendon-tibia shaft angle (PTTSA) is the sagittal plane angle between the tibia (ankle to knee joint) and the line of action of the patellar tendon. When the knee is near extension, an increased PTTSA produces a larger magnitude of anterior- directed force on the tibia and increases the loads transmitted to the ACL. It has been showed that females have greater PTTSA throughout the range of knee ﬂ exion compared to males, and that this angle is greater when the knee is close to full knee extension. However, no risk factor studies have included PTTSA in the analyses. The same is true for the slope of the tibial plateau in the sagittal plane. An increased slope of the plateau will gen- erate an increased anterior-directed force on the tibia when compression forces, such as that pro- duced during landing or plant and cut maneuvers, are produced across the knee. Movement patterns Another explanation for the gender difference in ACL injury rate is that females may perform a cer- tain movement different from males. Landing with straighter knees implies higher PTTSA and thereby an increased anterior-directed shear force compo- nent on the tibia. Although several studies have investigated if females land with straighter knees compared with males, there is no consensus in the literature."}

The same study showed that the valgus motion and valgus moments that were produced when landing from a jump predicted ACL injuries with a sensitivity of 78% and a speciﬁ city of 73%. Also, leg dominance was studied, but this factor was not found to be associated with risk of suffering an ACL injury. It should be mentioned that only nine ACL injuries were included in this study, so the results should be interpreted with caution until conﬁ rmed in other studies. For more information on how movement patterns can contribute to ACL injuries, see section on Injury mechanisms later. Other neuromuscular measures Several neuromuscular measures have been pro- posed as possible risk factors for ACL injury. Quadriceps dominance, muscle reaction time, time to peak force, muscle stiffness, and muscle strength and fatigue are all factors that may have an inﬂ uence on an athlete’s risk of suffering an ACL injury. It has been shown that females exhibit greater quadriceps dominance and that they have less muscle stiffness and muscle strength compared to males. However, none of these factors have been studied as ACL injury risk factors and conse- quently it is not possible to determine the relative importance of these factors at this point in time.

However, as is apparent from this chapter, our current knowl- edge on the many potential risk factors for serious knee injuries is limited. Perhaps, the most important from the athlete’s point of view is the ﬁ nding that a suboptimal movement pattern will increase the risk of such injuries. This ﬁ nding also agrees well with numer- ous studies that have shown beneﬁ cial effects of neuromuscular training programs focusing on strength, balance, and maintaining the “knee- over-toe” position during dynamic movements. Drop-jumps and one-legged squats are simple tests that can be used to screen athletes with poor strength, balance, and “knee-over-toe” control.

Nevertheless, if we can identify individuals at increased risk (e.g., athletes that are at increased risk of suffering ACL injury based on poor anatomic alignment), it may be possible to initiate individualized injury prevention measures on these individuals and reduce their risk of injury by enhancing their neu- romuscular control. Injury mechanisms A simple description of non-contact ACL injury situations in ball/team sports During most Olympic sports, ACL injuries are com- monly non-contact in nature and can occur during plant and cut maneuvers (Figure 5.3), but a high proportion of these injuries also occur during land- ings (Figure 5.4). In basketball, landings are the most frequently reported mechanism for ACL injuries. It is important to realize that while an ath- lete may appear to land on both feet with body weight equally distributed between legs, at the point of impact the entire ground reaction force may be supported by the leg that suffers an injury. Previous studies have suggested that the knee is near extension at the time of ligament injury (i.e., less than 30º); however, recent studies that have used more sophisticated video analysis with multiple camera angles indicate that the knee is injured when it is in a position of greater ﬂ exion. Although the majority of ACL injuries that occur in Olympic sports are non-contact by deﬁ nition, the movement patterns often involve perturba- tion by an opponent (e.g., body contact before the injury). However, even if a few details are known, we still lack vital knowledge about the injury mechanisms. A complete biomechanical descrip- tion should quantify entire body and knee kin- ematics, loading directions and magnitudes, and the rate of application of external and internal forces about the lower extremity. Knee ligament injury mechanisms in alpine skiing Knee ligament injury mechanisms that occur during traditional alpine skiing have been inves- tigated for some time, and various injury mecha- nisms have been proposed, both for ACL injuries and other ligament injuries."}
{"id": "199", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Some knee injury mechanisms are equipment related, such as when the back portion of the ski boot acts to produce a “boot-induced anterior drawer” (e.g., an anterior directed force on the tibia that tears the ACL), or when the edge of the ski is caught in the snow. Some injury mechanisms are associated with certain circumstances, such as a backward fall, with the weight of the skier on the inner edge of the tail of the ski resulting in a sharp uncontrolled inward twist of the lower leg (Figure 5.5). This sce- nario is termed as the “phantom foot mechanism” and is considered the most common ACL injury mechanism in alpine skiing. (a) (b) (c) Figure 5.3.

For injuries that are caused by a direct blow to the knee, which is the case for many MCL injuries, the loading patterns are more obvious. However, for non-contact ACL injuries, different hypotheses are heavily debated in the scientiﬁ c community. Valgus loading Studies have shown that external tibial rotation combined with valgus rotation with the knee in an extended or partially ﬂ exed position initiates ACL strain, as the ligament contacts and then impinges against the medial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle (Figure 5.6). The ligament impingement theory has also been suggested in video analysis studies. Although it remains unknown how the ligament impinges against the medial aspect of the lateral femoral con- dyle and strains the ACL, there is evidence that val- gus loading of the tibia relative to the femur is an important aspect of the loads applied to the knee during an ACL injury. A recent prospective risk fac- tor study showed that increased valgus loading when landing from a jump was associated with increased risk of suffering an ACL injury amongst soccer, bas- ketball, and volleyball athletes. Several studies also report that MCL injuries are frequently seen in com- bination with non-contact ACL injuries, indicat- ing that valgus loading was present. Interestingly, laboratory-based motion analysis studies have dem- onstrated that females develop larger magnitudes of valgus and external torques about the knee when landing from a jump in comparison to males, sug- gesting that knee valgus loading may explain, at least in part, the larger incidence rate of ACL inju- ries seen in females compared to males taking part in the same sport at the same level of competition. A recent video-based analysis study of actual ACL injury situations reported a large number of val- gus collapses about the knee for female athletes."}

However, there are likely to be other forces and tor- ques applied to the knee during injury, since it has been shown that pure valgus loading will rupture the MCL ﬁ rst, then the ACL secondly—only a lim- ited number of MCL ruptures are found in conjunc- tion with non-contact injury of ACL injuries. Quadriceps-induced anterior tibial drawer Several cadaver studies have shown that quad- riceps loading strains the ACL when the knee is near extension. It has been hypothesized that a vigorous quadriceps contraction when landing on an extended knee can produce high ACL strain values. In this theory, contraction of the quadriceps mus- cle group and subsequent engagement of the patel- lofemoral joint produces a load on the patella tendon which has an anterior-directed angulation relative to the tibia when the knee is near exten- sion, and this generates an anterior-directed force component on the tibia. As the knee is moved from an extended to a ﬂ exed position, the orientation of the patellar tendon relative to the tibia moves from an anterior to a posterior direction as does the cor- responding direction of the force produced by the quadriceps extensor mechanism. Understanding this biomechanical relationship, studies have investigated if the gender difference in ACL injury incidence can be explained by the fact that females appear to land with their knee and hip in a more extended position. The ﬁ ndings from these studies conﬂ ict. In actual injury situations, females are found to be at signiﬁ - cantly greater knee and hip ﬂ exion angles at initial contact with the playing surface and at the assumed point of injury in comparison to males.

Further investigations are required to delineate the role of quadriceps-induced anterior drawer loading of the tibia in producing ACL injuries. Internal tibial rotation There are several factors that suggest internal rota- tion of the tibia relative to the femur on a relatively extended knee could be a potential mechanism of non-contact ACL injuries. First, cadaver and human studies have shown that the ACL is strained when torques are applied to internally rotate the tibia rel- ative to the femur. Second, internal rotation is fre- quently reported to be the mechanism of injury in athlete interview studies, in video analysis, as well as suggested from the associated clinical ﬁ ndings. Motion analysis studies of sidestep cutting maneu- vers usually show a dominance of internal tibial rotation during the stance phase. However, males are reported to exhibit this pattern to a larger degree than females indicating that other loading scenarios are likely to be associated with many female non- contact ACL injuries. Hyperextension has also been proposed as a possible mechanism, but this seems unlikely considering that such injuries have not been reported in any video analysis studies. Take-home message Currently, little is known about the speciﬁ c knee loads that cause non-contact ACL injuries. What seems clear is that valgus loading is an important factor in many cases; implying that avoiding val- gus knee motion (or “kissing knees”) is important."}

In planning championships and Olympic Games, it is important to allow an ade- quate number of days for the athlete to recover. For young athletes who participate in sports at a high level, there is a clear tendency for participa- tion on many teams and to compete at different age levels. This increases the number of matches/ competition and reduces the time they have, available for rest and training. Every sports federa- tion should be aware of this and try to protect the young athletes from over participation in sports. Another aspect that must be considered for piv- oting sports that are performed on courts and turf is the friction between the ﬂ oor and the shoes. Playing surfaces with a low coefﬁ cient of friction can prevent ACL injuries. Athletic shoes should be designed to provide sufﬁ cient friction and mechanical interlock with the playing surface to allow optimal performance, not making pivoting difﬁ cult, yet not producing injury. Athletes who take part in sports that are performed on surfaces with different friction levels should consider the use of different types of shoes. For example, one for high- and another for low-friction playing surfaces."}

Among alpine skiers, it is extremely important that the athletes use equipment and bindings adjusted by trained and certiﬁ ed technicians.

For the optimal design of ACL intervention programs, we can learn much from a systematic analysis of the common components of the published inter- ventions, successful and unsuccessful, designed to reduce ACL injury risk in athletes. Analyzing the common components of the most effective and least effective programs is useful for the development of effective intervention protocols. Hewett et al., (2006a) performed a systematic review of interven- tion studies designed to reduce ACL injury risk in female athletes and revealed that several programs appear to reduce ACL injury risk. In contrast, other studies have failed to show an effect of neuromus- cular training on the reduction of ACL injury rates or establish that they can alter lower extremity bio- mechanics. Most of what is known has come from studies of female athletes, as they are at increased risk of ACL injury. As described earlier, the mecha- nism of ACL injury may differ between females and males, particularly with respect to the dynamic posi- tioning and control of the knee, as females demon- strate greater valgus collapse of the lower extremity, primarily in the coronal plane. However, female athletes may serve as a working model for any ath- lete at increased risk of suffering an ACL injury. In this section, we will describe many of the preven- tion methods and neuromuscular training programs and provide broad instructions and guidelines for the exercises."}
{"id": "209", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "In addition, we will review as many components of the successful, and unsuccessful, programs as possible within the speciﬁ c purview of ACL injury prevention in athletes. There appears to be a measurable effect of neu- romuscular training interventions on the reduction of severe knee and ACL injuries. A comprehensive review of the literature revealed that ﬁ ve of the six studies demonstrated neuromuscular training reduced lower extremity injury risk, four of the six studies found neuromuscular training reduced serious knee injury risk and three of the six reported decreased ACL injury risk (Hewett et al., 2006c). The components of the most successful programs are summarized later. In sum, plyomet- ric training and biomechanical analysis of landing, cutting, and jumping technique were common components of the studies that were effective at reducing the risk of ACL injury in athletes. Safety equipment Two investigations have studied the effect of pro- phylactic knee bracing on American football ath- letes (Sitler et al.,1990; Albright et al.,1994). The ﬁ rst study found signiﬁ cantly fewer MCL inju- ries occurred in athletes who used prophylactic bracing in comparison to those who did not use braces; however, the effect of prophylactic bracing on ACL injures could not be determined because of the small sample size (Sitler et al.,"}
{"id": "210", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "1990). In con- trast, the second study did not ﬁ nd statistically sig- niﬁ cant differences between braced and unbraced athletes in terms of the risk of sustaining MCL injuries (Albright et al.,1994). Additional research is needed in this area to establish the effect that prophylactic braces have on knee injuries. Although alpine ski bindings have been devel- oped to effectively protect skiers from tibia and ankle fractures, the present day alpine ski bind- ing designs are inadequate for preventing ACL disruptions, even when the bindings function as designed and are properly adjusted. In a large pro- spective study of ACL-deﬁ cient professional alpine skiers, the risk of sustaining a subsequent knee injury (e.g., injury to other structures about the knee such as articular cartilage and the menisci) was 6.4 times greater for non-braced skiers in com- parison to braced skiers (Kocherc et al.,2003). Targeting participation in ACL injury interventions to individuals or teams Athletes at the greatest risk of ACL injury should participate in neuromuscular training interven- tions to decrease the risk of injuring this important ligament. This approach is speciﬁ c to the individ- ual athlete. The neuromuscular training protocol should preferably be designed and instituted speciﬁ - cally for and with athletes selected for neuromus- cular training based on identiﬁ ed neuromuscular deﬁ ciencies and imbalances (Table 5.3)."}

Reeducation of the female neuromuscular system away from multi-planar motion of the knee to dynamic control of knee motion in the sagittal plane only is achieved through a progression of single, then multi-planar exercises. Quadriceps dominance (Table 5.3) can be cor- rected through the use of exercises that emphasize co-contraction of the knee ﬂ exor (hamstrings) and extensor (quadriceps) muscles. It is a challenging task to develop more appropriate ﬁ ring patterns for the knee ﬂ exors, while utilizing exercises that also strongly activate the knee extensors. At angles greater than 45º, the quadriceps is an antagonist to the ACL. Therefore, it is important to use deep knee ﬂ exion angles to put the quadriceps into an ACL agonist position. By training the athlete with deep knee ﬂ exion jumps, she learns to increase the amount of knee ﬂ exion and decrease the amount of time in the more dangerous straight-legged position. At the same time the athlete can repro- gram peak ﬂ exor/extensor ﬁ ring patterns, increas- ing co-ﬁ ring and quadriceps ﬁ ring in deep ﬂ exion for greater protection of the ACL. Dominant leg imbalance can be addressed in the female athlete via exercises that force the correction of dynamic contralateral imbalances (Table 5.3). These imbalances are addressed throughout the entire training protocol."}

These include progressive neuromus- cular training techniques that target the balanced and synchronized turn-on of the dynamic stabi- lizing musculature of the trunk, pelvis and hip. Unstable surfaces, single-leg balancing and pertur- bation training should be employed (Table 5.3).

Plyometrics is an important component for reduction of ACL injury risk in athletes The evidence for including a plyometric com- ponent as a portion of an ACL injury prevention program is relatively strong. A systematic review of the literature found that reduced ACL injury risk occurred in those interventions that included plyometrics as part of the training program, while those that did not include plyometrics did not reduce an ACL injury risk (Hewett et al.,2006c). The focus of plyometrics should be on proper land- ing, cutting, and jumping techniques and body mechanics during these movements. Training pro- grams that incorporate plyometrics result in safe levels of varus or valgus stress about the knee, and may increase “muscle dominant” and reduce “liga- ment dominant” neuromuscular control patterns while correcting for these and other neuromuscu- lar imbalances in athletes (Table 5.3). Studies by Hewett et al. (1996, 1999, 2006a), Myklebust et al. (2003), and Mandelbaum et al. (2005) all incorporated high intensity plyometric movements into the design of their intervention programs (Boxes 5.1 and 5.2), but the studies by Heidt et al. ("}
{"id": "216", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "2000) and Söderman et al. (2000), which did not reduce ACL injury risk, did not. This can be explained, at least in part, by the fact that the studies by Söderman et al. (2000) and Heidt et al. (2000) had little chance of establishing if their intervention could reduce the risk of injury because the sample size was likely too small and from this perspective these should be considered preliminary studies. With this caveat, the stud- ies that incorporated high intensity plyometrics reported reduced ACL injury risk, while the studies that did not incorporate high intensity plyomet- rics did not report reductions in ACL injury risk. Hence, the plyometric component of a pre-season intervention program appears to reduce serious ligamentous injuries, speciﬁ cally ACL injuries. Plyometrics may be used as combined analysis and training tools, with verbal or visual feedback, for control of body motion, both during decel- eration and acceleration, and knee loading, espe- cially with respect to the reduction of abduction (or “valgus”) torque about the knee. For example, Hewett et al. (1996, 1999, 2006a) have shown that tuck jumps force control of knee abduction torque (Box 5.1)."}

Movement biomechanics, technique and education components: coronal plane is key The evidence in support of including movement biomechanics, landing, cutting and jumping tech- nique, and education components of the effective interventions is also relatively strong. Olsen et al. (2005) have reported that in sports performed on court and turf surfaces most ACL injuries occur by non-contact mechanisms during landing and lateral pivoting. The biomechanics of these land- ing and cutting movements can be improved with neuromuscular training. Neuromuscular training can increase coronal and sagittal plane control of the lower extremity. For example, during a squat jump (Box 5.1), a two-footed plyometric activity, post training results show that lower extremity valgus alignment can be reduced at the knee and hip. Conversely, during a single-leg tasks such as a hop and hold maneuver (Box 5.1), the most sig- niﬁ cant changes may occur in the sagittal plane of the knee. There is strong evidence in support of landing, cutting and jumping technique training and its effect on reducing ACL injury risk. Hewett et al."}

It is important for us to point out that this may apply only to those subjects who have adequate strength prior to entering an injury prevention program. The proper “training dose:” How much and how often interventions should be performed Neuromuscular power can increase within 6 weeks of training and may result in decreases in peak impact forces and knee abduction torques. The evidence from the literature indicates that training sessions should be performed more than one time per week, preferably at least two and up to ﬁ ve times per week."}

Three exercise phases, such as technique, power, and performance phases are often utilized to facilitate progressions designed to improve the athletes’ ability to control body motion during dynamic activities. All exercises in each phase should be progressed to exercise tech- niques that incorporate perturbations that force the athlete to decelerate and control the body in multiple planes of motion, particularly the coronal plane, in order to successfully perform each tech- nique with optimal form and safety level. Several studies have highlighted the importance of the athlete’s ﬁ tness with regard to prevention of injuries. In relation to ACL injuries we know that in addition to strength, endurance, and general ﬁ tness it is highly recommended to improve every ath- lete’s sport speciﬁ c skills. This includes more “ACL- friendly” movements in the different sports, such as a two footed landings after a jump and two- to three- step stop instead of a one-step stop and pivoting. Finally, fair play is an important factor in our work for less serious injuries. In contact sports sometimes ACL injury is produced by brutal and unfair play. This is an educational and attitude challenge for coaches and ofﬁ cials."}
{"id": "237", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Take-home message There is good evidence that neuromuscular training decreases ACL injury incidence in female athletes. Plyometrics in combination with biomechanics and technique (e.g., jumping/landing) training appear to induce neuromuscular changes that reduce ACL injury risk. Increased lower extremity muscle recruitment and strength likely have a direct effect on the loading of the ACL during activities that involve cutting and landing. Though ACL injuries likely occur too quickly (less than 70 ms) for reﬂ ex- ive muscular activation (greater than 100 ms), ath- letes can adopt preparatory muscle recruitment and movement patterns that reduce the incidence of injuries caused by unexpected perturbations. The studies discussed earlier provide strong, but not une- quivocal, evidence that neuromuscular intervention training and education programs are likely to be an effective solution to the problem of gender inequity in ACL injury. Selective combination of neuromus- cular training components may provide additive effects, further reducing the risk of ACL injuries. It appears that plyometric power and biome- chanics technique training speciﬁ c to landing, cutting and jumping activities can induce neu- romuscular changes and prevent ACL injury, at least in female athletes. Balance, core stability, and strength training may be useful adjuncts. However, we do not yet know which of these components are most effective or whether their effects are com- binatorial. Future research efforts will assess the relative efﬁ cacy of these interventions alone and in combination in order to achieve the optimal effect in the most efﬁ cient manner possible."}

SA, Sports Medicine Clinic, Adelaide, Australia 2Department of Physiotherapy, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland 3Centre for Health, Exercise and Sports Medicine, School of Physiotherapy, University of Melbourne, Australia Epidemiology of hamstring injuries in sports Introduction The hamstring muscle group consists of three mus- cles of the posterior thigh, the biceps femoris, semi- tendinosus, and semimembranosus muscles. Their action is to extend the hip and ﬂ ex the knee and all three muscles are supplied by the sciatic nerve. In understanding the etymology of the word, ham refers to the hollow on the back of the human knee with string referring to the tendons that are present. Epidemiology of hamstring injuries in sports Hamstring muscle strains are common injuries in sports that have movement requirements with sudden acceleration and maximal sprinting. These include sports such as athletic sprinting and all of the football codes. Additionally in sports where the hamstring muscles are stretched beyond the usual movement of the muscles, in particular hip ﬂ ex- ion, also have a high frequency of hamstring mus- cle injury. Sports in this particular group include dancing and waterskiing. Hamstring strains are the ﬁ rst or second ranked injury in terms of injury inci- dence in the football codes such as soccer, rugby, Australian Rules football, and American football (Table 6.1). The incidence of hamstring muscle strain injuries has changed with studies from the 1980s indicating that ankle sprains were the most common type of injury in soccer, followed by knee sprains or hamstring strains. The more recent soccer studies indicate that the proportion of hamstring strains has increased with most modern studies indi- cating that hamstring strains are the most common injury in soccer (Hawkins & Fuller, 1999)."}

{"id": "251", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Preventing hamstring injuries 73 Diagnosis of hamstring injuries The diagnosis of hamstring muscle strain injury generally involves the sudden onset of posterior thigh pain whilst accelerating/sprinting. Usually the athlete cannot compete further due to the injury and has varying degrees of dysfunction over the subsequent days/weeks depending on the sever- ity of the injury. Pain on resisted hamstring con- traction is the most common clinical sign with the frequency of thigh tenderness and the presence of visible bruising being variable (Figure 6.1) (Verrall et al.,2003). Traditionally clinical diagnosis has been used in scientiﬁ c studies to signify the presence of hamstring muscle strain injury. However recent use of imaging, in particular MRI, has demonstrated that there may be variation in the classical previ- ously accepted clinical picture. Some cases vary by demonstrating a hamstring injury on imaging despite an insidious onset of injury with few clini- cal signs, whereas others demonstrate no hamstring injury despite classical clinical signs suggesting in these cases a different etiology for the posterior thigh pain (Verrall et al.,2003). From this it can be stated that when reporting research on hamstring injuries, imaging should be used to verify the injury but for general day-to-day management of injured athletes with the common mechanism of injury, clinical judgement should sufﬁ ce. This may not be the case for elite level athletes as MRI has recently been shown to have some ability in predicting injury prognosis (Slavotinek et al.,"}
{"id": "252", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "2002; Connell et al.,2004). Athletes that have posterior thigh inju- ries with negative MRI scan results for hamstring muscle injury have a much better prognosis with respect to an earlier return to sport and a marked decrease in injury recurrence rate when compared to athletes with posterior thigh injuries and positive MRI scan results with respect to hamstring muscle injury (Verrall et al.,2003). Time loss from hamstring injuries In soccer, Australian Rules football and rugby the average absence from competition due to hamstring muscle strain injury has been shown to be 17–25 days, with athletes generally missing 2–3 weekly matches. However due to the troublesome nature of these injuries the range of days of absence can be considerably higher. These ﬁ gures are derived from studies on hamstring muscle injury in these sports. Many sports have no available data on the effect on athletes due to hamstring injury. In Australian foot- ball there is a high recurrence rate for re-injury with studies demonstrating that this can be as high as 35%. Similar recurrent injury rates can also be seen in soccer with studies demonstrating re-injury rates of between 12% and 35%."}
{"id": "253", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Other sports have not completed research in this important area but it is likely that recurrent injuries would be common. In elite level soccer approximately three injuries can be expected per 1000 playing hours (Árnason et al.,2004). A team playing 50 matches per sea- son results in approximately 800 h of match play- ing time. Therefore it is expected that on average that each team will have two to three injuries per year during matches, as well as one to two during training (see later). In practice it is demonstrated, and this data derives from Australian Rules foot- ball, that there is much variation in the incidence of injury between teams. At this stage it is unclear whether sub-elite or club level results in a lower, or higher, frequency of hamstring injury. Younger teams, underage athletes, have been demonstrated to have fewer hamstring muscle injuries. The most commonly injured hamstring muscle is the biceps femoris (long head) muscle, followed Figure 6.1. Hamstring injury with resultant posterior thigh bruising."}

This may in part be dependent on the mechanism of the hamstring injury but in many cases more than one hamstring muscle is injured in any single muscle injury. At this time the impli- cations with respect to athlete return to sport and recurrence rate is not known when comparing sin- gle or multiple muscle injuries. It is known that the larger the demonstrated muscle injury, the worse prognosis the athlete has (Verrall et al.,2006) but whether for the same size injury to have one mus- cle injured or more than one muscle injured and affect on athlete prognosis is unclear at this time. Imaging studies have demonstrated that ham- string muscle injuries, in fact all muscle strain injuries, involve the musculotendinous junc- tion (Garrett, 1996; Slavotinek et al.,2002). Some hamstring muscle injuries only involve the proxi- mal or distal tendons, this is less than 10% of the total number of hamstring strain injuries. With the majority of hamstring muscle strain inju- ries involving the biceps femoris the injury loca- tion is evenly divided to above (proximal muscle injury) and below (distal muscle injury) the short head of biceps insertion into the long head of the biceps femoris (Slavotinek et al.,2002; Connell et al.,"}
{"id": "256", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "2004). Although research is incomplete on this area there does not appear to be a large differ- ence in athlete prognosis when comparing higher injuries to lower injuries. This does not apply to proximal tendon injuries as these athletes do have a signiﬁ cantly worse prognosis with respect to return to sport. The exception to this is where the hamstring muscle is injured in an overstretched type mechanism, such as dancing and waterskiing. These athletes are more likely to have a proximal muscle/tendon injury. Key risk factors: how to identify athletes at risk Despite the high incidence of hamstring strains in several popular sports, research on their speciﬁ c risk factors is limited. Most studies that measure risk fac- tors for hamstring strains have been performed on male subjects in Australian Rules football and soccer. These studies have varied in their size and methodology with differing injury deﬁ nitions and statistical analyses being used, thereby making it difﬁ cult to be conclusive about the ﬁ ndings that these studies have generated. However some ﬁ nd- ings have been similar in nearly all the studies that have been conducted. In particular the two most consistent ﬁ ndings associated with hamstring strain injury include having a history of a previous ham- string strain injury and being of older age."}
{"id": "257", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "A sum- mary of internal and external risk factors can be seen in Table 6.2. Previous hamstring strain injury Studies on risk factors for hamstring strain injury have consistently demonstrated that previous hamstring strain injury is a principal risk factor for hamstring muscle strain injury. In elite soccer the risk for hamstring injury has been shown to increase by between 3.5 and 11.6 times for previ- ously injured players compared to players without previous hamstring injury (Árnason et al.,2004). In Australian football a previous hamstring injury has been shown to increase hamstring injury risk by 2.1–6.3 times the risk for previously uninjured players (Verrall et al.,2001). Reports from studies of several sports show that re-injury rates are high and this demonstrates the troublesome nature of hamstring muscle strain injuries. It is considered that the presence of a previ- ous injury predisposes to future injury by chang- ing the muscle properties so that following injury and subsequent athlete rehabilitation and muscle repair the muscle is less able to absorb force mak- ing it more prone to re-injury. In effect the scar- ring of the muscle affects the muscle properties particularly in attenuating force from the mus- cle to the tendon making the entire muscle at increased risk for re-injury (Taylor et al.,1993)."}

Older age of athlete Most studies indicate that increased age is a risk factor for hamstring strains in adult male soccer (relative risk/odds ratio 1.1–1.4) (Árnason et al., 2004) and Australian Rules football (relative risk/ odds ratio 1.3) (Verrall et al.,2001). These ratios estimate the increase in risk for the athlete for a 1 year increase in age. Multivariate statistical analy- ses presented in risk factor studies suggest that this increase in risk with age is independent of whether the athlete had a previous hamstring muscle injury. The incidence of hamstring strains in Australian Rules football has also been shown to be higher in senior players when compared to junior players. It is also interesting to note that in junior level, ham- string strain is the fourth most common injury in terms of injury incidence whereas in the adult level it is the most common injury. Similar results have also been found in soccer. Studies have shown that with increased age there will be a reduction in the cross-sectional area of skeletal muscles, considered to be primarily as a consequence of a reduction in size and number of Type II muscle ﬁ bers."}

These factors could possi- bly predispose older athletes to hamstring strains. Other possible confounding factors such as previ- ous hamstring strains, decreased ﬂ exibility, and increased muscle fatigue could increase the risk of hamstring strains in older athletes compared to younger athletes. Although increased age itself is not modiﬁ able, some of these age-related con- founding factors could be modiﬁ able and working with these factors could possibly lower the risk of hamstring strains in older athletes.

Examples of MRI-detected small and large hamstring injuries with their subsequent size measurement can be viewed in Figure 6.2a, b, c. The reason for this high rate of recurrence could be changes in structure or scar tissue formation in or near the muscular tendinous junction after the previous injury, as scar tissue is proposed to be less func- tional compared to the original tissue (Taylor et al., 1993).

While the optimal rehabilitation program is not entirely clear, it would seem advisable not to allow athletes to participate too early after hamstring strain in sports that require high demand on speed, jumping, acceleration, deceleration, extreme ham- string ﬂ exibility, etc. Race Some studies have shown that soccer players of black origin and Australian Rules football play- ers of aboriginal decent sustain signiﬁ cantly more hamstring strains than white players. It has been proposed that these players are generally con- sidered to be the fastest in their particular sport when compared to their white counterparts. This has lead to the conclusion that these athletes have increased risk for hamstring injury due to their muscles having a higher proportion of type II mus- cle ﬁ bers in order to develop faster speed. A faster speed is considered to generate higher hamstring stressors and this maybe the reason for increased injury risk. Hamstring muscle strength and hamstring/quadriceps strength ratio Some studies have indicated that decreased ham- string strength, inadequate hamstring/quadriceps strength ratio, and a difference in right/left ham- string strength ratio could be potential risk factors for hamstring strains. This is based on the premise that the hamstring is weak relative to the quadri- ceps and therefore the leg develops too much leg extension force that needs to be counteracted by the ﬂ exion action of the hamstrings leading to subsequent hamstring injury."}
{"id": "264", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "However it should be noted that other studies have reported results that conﬂ ict with these ﬁ ndings. The studies that have been performed all use a dynamometer to measure the concentric and eccentric strength of the ham- string and quadriceps with the resultant produc- tion of a Hamstring to Quadriceps (H:Q) strength ratio. The obvious advantage of this is that it is an easily quantiﬁ able ratio and can potentially be modiﬁ ed by speciﬁ c training of the muscle consid- ered to be deﬁ cient in strength. However further research needs to be performed in this area before there will be universal agreement as to the valid- ity of this approach in the possible prevention of hamstring injuries. It is also not possible to be speciﬁ c about the optimal H:Q ratio and whether this ratio should be calculated using concentric or eccentric force production, as this have not been reliably determined. In recent years there has been more emphasis on the eccentric action of the hamstring muscles and many rehabilitation pro- grams and prevention programs emphasize eccen- tric strength training and conditioning. In interpreting the various studies, difﬁ culties arise in comparing methodology on how the strength of the quadriceps/hamstrings were measured, the reproducibility of the method, and, more impor- tantly, what exactly constituted a hamstring injury. These two factors are probably important in explain- ing conﬂ icting study results (Bennell et al.,1998). In conclusion, an imbalance in muscle strength between the hamstrings and quadriceps muscles is an area that warrants further research as it possibly a risk factor for hamstring injury."}
{"id": "265", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "If this was proven to be the case it is also an area where the risk factor may be more easily, relative to other approaches, modiﬁ able. Flexibility Many investigators have discussed the possibil- ity that poor hamstring ﬂ exibility could be a risk factor for hamstring strains. Different methods are used for testing hamstring muscle ﬂ exibility in different studies so comparison between these studies is difﬁ cult. In general there is a paucity of evidence and the methodology has been relatively poor thereby not allowing deﬁ nitive conclusions to be drawn. Although ﬂ exibility is not as easy to measure when compared to the hamstring to quadriceps strength ratio, muscle ﬂ exibility is also an area that warrants further research. If ﬂ exibil- ity, increased or decreased, can be demonstrated to be a risk factor for subsequent hamstring injury, it has the potential to be more easily modiﬁ ed."}
{"id": "266", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "78 Chapter 6 Competition versus training While it is generally accepted that hamstring strains occur more frequently during competition, as opposed to training sessions, this information is only available for a limited number of sports (Table 6.1), as research is incomplete in this area. Hamstring muscle strain injuries occur more commonly in competitive matches compared to training. It has been demonstrated that the likelihood of sustain- ing a hamstring injury during a competitive match as compared to during training may be increased up to 10 times in high-risk sports such as soccer and Australian football (Garrett, 1996; Verrall et al., 2003). A possible reason for this is that competitive matches usually involve more intense effort over a longer time period when compared to the usual training situation. This may lead to increased fatigue and a larger total amount of load (force) on the ham- string muscle making it more prone to injury. Muscle fatigue Studies from soccer show an increased incidence of hamstring strains during the last third of the ﬁ rst and second half of matches (Hawkins & Fuller, 1999). This is generally used to indicate that fatigue may be a risk factor for hamstring injury. Similar results have also been demonstrated in rugby and Australian football with hamstring muscle strain injuries occurring in the latter part of the game or time period. Fatigued muscles have been demonstrated in laboratory studies to be able to absorb less force than their non-fatigued counterparts (Mair et al.,"}
{"id": "267", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "1996). The absorption (attenuation) of force gen- erated by the moving leg is a very important func- tion of the hamstring muscles during running. It is this reduction in force attenuation that is con- sidered to be the reason why fatigued muscles are at increased risk for injury. Level of competition play Studies on players from soccer and Australian Rules football have shown that hamstring strains are more common in higher, more professional leagues. The reasons for this have not been fully elucidated but the increased training and playing demands of the higher levels of competition are considered to in some way increase hamstring strain risk. Player position on ﬁ eld Player position on the ﬁ eld of play has been shown to be important in some sports including backs hav- ing a higher incidence of injury compared to for- ward in rugby and wide receivers having a higher incidence in American football. In Australian foot- ball and soccer the midﬁ eld players are considered to be at higher risk for hamstring muscle strain injury. The reason for this increased risk in these players in these sports is similar to the argument proposed to explain the increased risk seen in some ethnic groups. Players in these positions are usually amongst the fastest for that particular sport. Insufﬁ cient warm-up It is considered that an insufﬁ cient warm-up may increase the risk for subsequent hamstring muscle strain injury."}
{"id": "268", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "The proposed mechanism for this is that insufﬁ cient warm-up leads to muscles being more viscous and less elastic with poorer neuromus- cular coordination. There is little or no scientiﬁ c evidence for this assertion, except animal stud- ies showing that the load to failure is higher after warm-up. However, warm-up should be undertaken to adequately prepare the athlete for competition and not just for an injury prevention role. Take-home message Knowledge of potential risk factors for hamstring muscle strains are important for the development of preventive measures. In the majority of cases, the causes of hamstring strains can be considered to be multifactorial with a complex series of events leading to injury. In this regard there are many potential risk factors that may lead given the right set of conditions to a hamstring strain. Current knowledge suggests players with a previ- ous hamstring injury and older players are almost certainly at an increased risk for subsequent ham- string muscle injury. These athletes in particu- lar should be targeted for prevention programs."}

Finally it should be considered that different sports, and different athletes within those sports, probably have different risk factors. Therefore it is not surprising that in most studies, measurement of a single potential risk factor almost always fails to predict hamstring muscle strain injury occurrence. Injury mechanisms for hamstring muscle injuries Basic principles of hamstring muscle strain injury The typical injury mechanism for hamstring mus- cle strains is unknown as there is little scientiﬁ c lit- erature addressing the topic. As a basic principle it can be stated that hamstring muscle strain injuries result from an increase in biomechanical load that exceeds the tolerance of the hamstring muscle(s). In understanding the mechanism of hamstring muscle strain injuries we need to consider factors that may increase or decrease biomechanical load on the hamstring muscle. In addition factors that change the load tolerance of the muscle(s) also need to be considered. Intuitively in most cases it is difﬁ cult to see how a change in the biomechanical load to the mus- cle during athletic performance can be affected. The Olympic motto of faster, higher, stronger, and the demands of modern day sport suggest that the demands on the athlete and the muscles that propel the athlete are more likely to increase over time rather than decrease. Therefore in look- ing at hamstring muscle strain injury mechanisms with a view to prevention, how factors change the load tolerance of the hamstring muscle are prob- ably more important as there is more potential to modify some of these factors."}
{"id": "270", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Factors that reduce the load tolerance of the hamstring muscle may render the hamstring muscle more susceptible to injury from what would generally be considered to be normally tolerated biomechanical loads and forces. We also need to examine factors that may increase the load tolerance of the hamstring mus- cles as this would obviously be useful in the pre- vention of hamstring muscle strain injuries. Excessive biomechanical load In some cases the mechanism, whether increased biomechanical load or decreased load tolerance, can be determined by understanding the nature of the sport and subsequent injury pattern. An example of a hamstring muscle strain injury in a sport where the biomechanical load obviously exceeds the load tolerance of the hamstring muscle(s) is the typical water skiing injury. In this sport the typical injury occurs when the athlete is forcibly pulled over with a forced ﬂ exion of the trunk and a fully extended leg, usually during a starting (take-off) maneuver. This results in an excessive load on the hamstring muscles with subsequent injury. In this case the mechanism of injury is indisputable. It is worth noting that these excessive force injuries, when seen in a clinical setting, are often more severe and may involve all three hamstring muscles compared to the typical running sport injury. Another example where this mechanism (exces- sive load) may be the predominant mechanism for injury is those sports where the muscle and leg is hyperextended as the athlete attempts a sport- speciﬁ c movement. Examples can be seen in dance and sports that involve kicking, particularly over- head kicking (Askling et al.,"}
{"id": "271", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "2007). Reduced load tolerance The most common situation for a hamstring mus- cle strain injury occurs when the athlete is sprint- ing and/or accelerating. This action is common to many sports but especially in track running and in all of the football codes around the world. The considered mechanism for injury in these cases is predominately a reduction in the load tolerance of the hamstring muscle making it more susceptible to the strain injury as opposed to an increase in biomechanical load. This assertion comes from the observation that most injuries occur randomly in"}

This leads to the conclusion that a decreased load tolerance is the most likely explanation. In other words the load- bearing properties of the muscle are altered in such a manner that the muscle can no longer tolerate a load that it had previously tolerated. This injury event is generally a sudden onset in nature and generally unpredictable. In one stride the athlete and hamstring muscle, are functioning normally and suddenly in the next stride the athlete sustains a hamstring injury. Factors that may be important in reducing the load tolerance properties of the hamstring muscle are often considered to be risk factors for injury. These have been discussed in the earlier section. However it can be said that in most cases how each of the earlier described risk factors reduces the capacity of the hamstring muscle to resist nor- mally tolerated forces is unclear and the reasons for injury are speculative. Similarly the weight- ing or importance of each risk factor has not been determined at this time. It should also be remembered that in the sports involving body contact there exists the possibility that in some cases of hamstring injury, too much load on the hamstring muscle is the predominant mechanism of injury rather than a reduced capac- ity of muscle to absorb force."}
{"id": "273", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "This includes sports involving tackling where the athlete tries to force against resistance. In some cases the resistance can result in an excessive force to the hamstring muscle, for example, in an American football or rugby scrim- mage line, or when the athletes’ leg is ﬁ xed (trapped) whilst they are trying to accelerate or sprint. Predominant hamstring muscle injured The most common hamstring muscle injured as a consequence of reduced load tolerance of the ham- string muscle is the long head of biceps femoris muscle. This is followed in frequency by the semi- tendinosus and then the semimembranosus mus- cles, respectively. The short head of biceps femoris muscle is infrequently injured and at this current time is not considered to be an important muscle in the pathogenesis of hamstring muscle strain injury. We understand the different frequency of muscle injuries from the results of imaging stud- ies undertaken in running athletes (Slavotinek et al.,2002; Connell et al.,2004) where reduced load tolerance is suspected to be a key factor in injury pathogenesis. At this time little research has been undertaken as to why the biceps femoris (long head) is the most susceptible to muscle stretch injury as a consequence of a reduced ability to resist normal loading forces whilst the athlete is sprinting. Important factors that may be unique to the biceps femoris muscle include the rate (velocity) and the amount of stretch of the muscle that occurs in the muscle and tendon, its anatomical location and the amount of force (load) that needs to be dissipated by this muscle."}
{"id": "274", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "In hamstring muscle strain injuries where exces- sive force is the considered mechanism it is often shown, by imaging studies, that more than one muscle is injured. At this time it is not clear which muscle is the predominant muscle injured. Musculotendinous junction The most common anatomical location of hamstring muscle injuries is the musculotendinous junction. The reasons for this are unclear but it may represent a site of comparative weakness. In the case of the biceps femoris muscle, the most commonly injured hamstring muscle, injuries appear to be evenly dis- tributed in proximal and distal sites as deﬁ ned by whether the injury is above or below the insertion of the short head of the biceps femoris muscle into the long head. Again this has been determined princi- pally by imaging studies performed on running ath- letes (Slavotinek et al.,2002; Connell et al.,2004).

It is also considered that the muscle is most vul- nerable in the late phase of the swing cycle but the exact reasons for this as well as the actual bio- mechanical events leading up to and causing the failure of the muscle are not known at this time. As discussed in the risk factors section, fatigue is considered to be an important factor in the patho- genesis of hamstring muscle injury by reducing the load tolerance that the muscle can withstand (Mair et al.,1996). It is therefore not surprising that many hamstring muscle strain injuries occur late in a game or training when fatigue is at its maximum and in the phase of the gait cycle where the most force needs to be generated by the ham- string muscle, that is, the eccentric swing phase. The consequence of these factors leads to a rela- tive force overload to the hamstring muscle with subsequent injury. Take-home message The current state of knowledge suggests the fol- lowing mechanisms for hamstring muscle strain injury: (1) overwhelming force to the muscle, (2) overstretch of the muscle, and (3) reduced load tolerance of the muscle. The majority of injuries occur during sprinting and/or acceleration and this suggests that reduced load tolerance of the muscle is the most common mechanism of ham- string injury. Reduced load tolerance of the mus- cle may well be, at least in part, the function of a fatiguing (fatigued) muscle. This fact has implica- tions in the prevention of hamstring injury with the avoidance of muscle fatigue by training the muscle to better tolerate fatigue being the corner- stone of many current hamstring injury preven- tion programs."}
{"id": "277", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Other common risk factors are less able to be inﬂ uenced. In effect increasing age, hav- ing a previous injury, and being a faster player are inherently unchangeable risk factors. However more research needs to be undertaken on the mechanisms of hamstring muscle strain injuries and it is possible that with better under- standing this list may change substantially. Finally, it can be stated that at this time it is not known whether the mechanism of hamstring muscle strain injury is important in the pathogenesis and subsequent recovery of the injury and whether this alters the risk for subsequent re-injury. For example, it is not known whether an overstretch or excessive force injury is better or worse in terms of athlete prognosis than a sprinting/acceleration decreased load tolerance injury. Identifying risks in the training and competition programs Little is known about the differing risks between the competitive games and training programs. As stated earlier hamstring injuries are more likely to occur in the competitive match situation com- pared to training so it is possible that different risks exist for these different situations or more likely the risks are magniﬁ ed in the competitive match situation. Some other general non-speciﬁ c observations have been made to identify risks in training and competition, but the reasons for these observations are speculative.

{"id": "279", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "82 Chapter 6 The reasons for this observation are not known. Pre-season training programs have been primarily designed to improve the ﬁ tness of the participants. In many cases improving athletes’ ﬁ tness is done in a manner that is not particularly sport speciﬁ c with many training regimens not replicating the speciﬁ c energy demands of the sport. This is espe- cially true for sports, such as the football codes, that have extensive aerobic and anaerobic require- ments with multiple sprinting (maximal efforts) being required over an extended time period. An example of this lack of sport speciﬁ city is to train a soccer player by running in 5 km time trials in the pre-season. In a competitive game this type of aerobic running is not generally consistent with how the game is played—the running require- ments in a typical soccer game involve recurrent interval sprinting with maximal and sub-maximal efforts with each effort generally not lasting more than 6 s in time or 50 m in distance. It is therefore considered that many early season hamstring muscle strain injuries are the result of the failure of the muscle to adapt to the increased load (force) that is required to be absorbed when there is a transition from predominately aerobic conditioning that is used in the pre-season train- ing program to the actual requirement of the competitive sport—recurrent maximal anaero- bic sprinting efforts. Thus when the competitive matches commence (including the late pre-season trial games) more hamstring injuries occur as the muscle has not yet adapted to the increased load requirements that is speciﬁ c to the running demands of competitive sport. An early season predominance of hamstring injuries has been demonstrated in some sports including Australian rules football (Orchard & Seward, 2002) and soc- cer (Hawkins & Fuller, 1999). Understanding this transition risk factor can assist in developing an effective prevention program."}
{"id": "280", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "It is also clear that aerobic conditioning is an important component in most sports. Recent research suggests that it is even more important in track sprinting than had been previously recog- nized. Most football codes require predominately interval maximal anaerobic efforts followed by a limited, or in many cases no, recovery period. It is in the limited recovery period where aerobic conditioning is important. Therefore a pre- season conditioning program requires both aerobic conditioning and anaerobic interval sprint condi- tioning in order to attain maximal sport-speciﬁ c ﬁ tness for the athlete. Current best practice sug- gests that if a change from a predominately aerobic program to a predominately anaerobic program is considered then this transition should involve a gradual, rather than an abrupt, change from one form of training to another. In this way there may be a reduction in the early season risk of hamstring muscle strain injury. Furthermore once the playing season has commenced it is now considered that the predominant form of ﬁ tness undertaken at practice should be in the same manner with respect to anaerobic/aerobic components, as is needed in competitive matches. Recent studies on hamstring injuries in female elite soccer and elite Australian football have demonstrated reduced hamstring injuries in athletes that undertook a pre-season training program that was, in part, undertaken to attempt to decrease hamstring injury occurrence (Mjølsnes et al.,2004; Verrall et al.,"}

A summary of these methods are presented in the hamstring injury prevention matrix shown in Table 6.3. Improving training speciﬁ city At the highest level of participation most athletes require an extreme level of ﬁ tness especially in sports such as the football codes where the ath- letes can compete for up to 2 h. In many of the pre-season and in season training programs for these football codes there has been an emphasis on aerobic conditioning as the predominant training. However the energy requirements of most foot- ball codes require the athletes to be able to cope with high-intensity anaerobic interval maximal or sub-maximal sprinting efforts. As discussed in the mechanisms section, it is in the process of the intensive anaerobic effort, the sprint, that many hamstring muscle strain injuries occur. Most sports with similar energy requirements should consider improving the speciﬁ city of train- ing so that the athletes are better able to cope with match day, the principal time of hamstring mus- cle strain injury, running stressors. Thus “training as the game is played” should prevent hamstring injuries by improving hamstring muscle condi- tioning and developing improved fatigue resist- ance. There is evidence to support this proposition (Heidt et al.,2000; Verrall et al.,2005)."}
{"id": "283", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Improving fatigue resistance There is evidence that fatigued muscles are able to absorb less energy than non-fatigued muscles. Therefore by improving the speciﬁ city of training and muscle conditioning it may be possible to pre- vent hamstring muscle strain injuries by making the muscle more fatigue resistant and better able to absorb energy loads particularly in the eccentric phase of the gait cycle action where the muscle is most commonly injured. Identifying at-risk athletes The principal risk factors for hamstring muscle injury are increasing age of the athlete and the ath- lete having a previous history of hamstring injury. These risk factors cannot be altered. However iden- tifying these athletes in the team group, inform- ing these athletes of their at-risk status, and then targeting prevention programs to these particular athletes is a strategy that may prove worthwhile in preventing hamstring injuries. Strengthening Increased hamstring muscle strength has long been considered to help prevent hamstring injuries, and recent scientiﬁ c evidence supports this proposi- tion.

This exercise program has been shown to increase the eccentric hamstring strength (measured at 60º/s) by 11% in a period of 10 weeks of training (Árnason et al.,2008). A 4 year study of 17–30 Norwegian and Icelandic elite soccer teams indicated that teams that used the Nordic hamstring lowers exercise combined with stretching of short duration during warm-up reduced their risk of hamstring strains by 57% com- pared to teams that did not use the program during the same season (Árnason et al.,2008). The inter- vention teams also showed a lower incidence of hamstring strains than the same teams during the baseline seasons (58% lower rate).

Rehabilitation of hamstring injuries and the relationship to prevention of injuries For hamstring muscle strain injuries, in fact for all muscle strain injuries, the rehabilitation program fol- lowing injury is an important factor in attempting to prevent re-injury. This is due to the observation that the most important risk factor for hamstring mus- cle injury is previous injury. Hence many hamstring injuries are actually re-injuries, thereby making the components of the original rehabilitation program important in preventing hamstring (re)injury. Studies of Australian rules football players dem- onstrate that this risk for re-injury occurs prin- cipally for the ﬁ rst 8 weeks following an injury. Unfortunately there are very few studies demon- strating the effects of rehabilitation programs on re-injury risk.

There is little scientiﬁ c evidence for the intensity, duration, and timing for any exercise that is intro- duced in the immediate post-injury period. However it is generally accepted that controlled exercise, as opposed to rest, should be introduced early in the rehabilitation period. Histological evidence demon- strates that muscle injury repair involves scar for- mation at the site of injury. It is considered that the formed scar does not have the same properties as the pre-existing muscle with respect to load attenu- ation making the injured muscle and surrounding muscle area more prone to further injury (re-injury). By commencing activities early in the post-injury period it is thought that the scar formation at the site of injury will be improved in terms of attaining properties that are more like the pre-existing mus- cle. This would then result in an increased tolerance of the muscle to load when more strenuous activity is recommenced with a subsequent reduced risk for re-injury. There is some supportive histopathological evidence for this proposition. Further evidence for introducing stretches and activities early in the reha- bilitation period comes from studies that examine the length–tension curve of previously injured ath- letes (Brockett et al.,2004)."}

In Australian football the re-injury rate is ~30% (Orchard & Seward, 2002). There is about a one in three risk of an athlete with a hamstring muscle strain injury of sustaining another strain injury on the same side, with a high proportion of these re-occurring in the rehabilita- tion and/or the immediate return to sport period. In Australian Rules football there is an increased risk for hamstring muscle re-injury for up to 8 weeks after the athlete returns to sport. The re-injury risk drops to less than 4% after the athlete has played eight matches. In many cases this time period can be 3 months from the original hamstring muscle strain injury. Recent trends in this sport have been to manage these injuries more conservatively. These increas- ingly conservative measures include: 1."}

Table 6.5 Components of a hamstring muscle strain injury rehabilitation program. Progression/action Rationale At injury Remove from ﬁ eld of play Prevent further injury Apply ice and compression Prevent bleeding of injury. Recent evidence from MRI studies of hamstring muscle strain injuries suggests bleeding is not a common outcome of these injuries. If bleeding is demonstrated to be present clinically, usually at day 2 or 3 following injury, by the presence of a bruise, then this generally signiﬁ es a higher grade (more severe) hamstring injury. However despite the lack of evidence for ice application for hamstring injuries it is still recommended that it is performed post-injury. Immediate post-injury period Commence stretching and weight-bearing activities Aids in the healing of the injury with the aim being an earlier and more successful (in terms of a reduction in injury recurrence), return to sport. Commence non-weight-bearing activities (e.g., cycling, swimming) Prevent athlete deconditioning in the rehabilitation period. Introduce anti-inﬂ ammatory medication Overall there is little evidence for this approach and some contention. In support of this it can be considered that the anti-inﬂ ammatories can act as an analgesic and therefore allow an earlier commencement of activities in rehabilitation."}

Introduction of speciﬁ c sport skill exercises To ensure the athlete is ready for return to play. Commence strengthening Improve the strength of the muscle making the muscle less prone to re-injury as the muscle is able to absorb more force for any given length or tension. There is however little scientiﬁ c evidence to support this proposition and therefore many hamstring rehabilitation programs do not have a formal strengthening component.

Thermal pants Expert opinion has suggested that wearing thermal pants to keep the hamstring muscle warm may be useful in hamstring injury prevention, though lit- tle evidence exists to prove their efﬁ cacy. Warm-up Inadequate warm-up has long been considered to be a risk factor for injury though little evidence exists for this assertion. It can be stated that warm- up is probably more useful in preparing the athlete for best performance during competition rather than being useful for injury prevention. Changing the sport to decrease the number of hamstring injuries Aside from the inconvenience to the athlete and the team, and in professional sport this inconven- ience can be considerable and have a signiﬁ cant impact on the playing level and professional remu- neration for the athlete that sustains the injury, in most cases a hamstring muscle strain injury has no long-term negative health consequence for the athlete.

Current trends in implementing hamstring muscle injury prevention (Aussie Rules program) In a rapidly changing ﬁ eld some of the current trends in training athletes for the purpose of hamstring injury prevention, and their rationale for their introduction, can be seen in Table 6.7. This program has been developed based on some basic principles related to implementing sports- speciﬁ c testing procedures, speciﬁ c training drills that more closely reﬂ ect the requirements of the sport, increasing hamstring muscle stretching whilst muscle is fatigued, avoiding exercises that may cause a mismatch in hamstring to quadriceps strength, and avoiding exercises that may change the length–tension curve of the hamstring mus- cles in a negative fashion. There is some evidence that training based on these principles may reduce injury risk signiﬁ cantly (Verrall et al.,2005). Take-home message There is a need for more well-conducted research into the area of hamstring injury prevention, but there is however enough evidence to make some recommendations that may be useful in ham- string injury prevention. This includes eccentric strengthening exercises, sports-speciﬁ c testing and conditioning programs, and appropriate rehabili- tation after injury. However, this is a ﬁ eld that is rapidly changing as more evidence about what works (and what does not) emerge.

Implementing testing procedures that measure the performance requirements (high-intensity interval sprinting) of the sport Most team sports particularly at the elite playing level measure athletic performance in the pre-season to gauge the ﬁ tness of the athlete. Often the athlete focuses his/her training with an emphasis on performing well at this measure. As “training as the game is played” is the goal of pre-season conditioning, with respect to hamstring injury prevention, then using measures of anaerobic interval performance are preferable to aerobic performance. An example of this is the use of the 20 m repeated shuttle run test (multi-stage ﬁ tness testing) rather than the 3 km time trial performance.2. Implementing speciﬁ c training drills that more closely reﬂ ect match day conditions Improving muscle conditioning and anaerobic performance and obtaining fatigue resistance.3. Increasing the number of hamstring muscle stretching regimes whilst muscle is fatigued Increasing energy absorption of hamstring muscle for any given length of muscle and improving fatigue resistance.4."}
{"id": "300", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Avoiding exercises that may lower the hamstring to quadriceps strength ratio An example of this is the increasing use of closed kinetic chain exercises for weights training rather than open kinetic chain exercises as these latter exercises are more likely to alter the H:Q ratio. Quadriceps to hamstring strength ratios have been shown to be predictive for hamstring muscle strain injury. Therefore any exercise that may possibly change this ratio should be avoided especially in athletes without previous history of hamstring injury.5. Avoiding exercises that may change the length– tension curve of the hamstring muscles in a negative fashion An example of this would be to increase the volume of slow running or cross training using stationery cycling in athletes that require their length–tension curves to be maximal, that is, athletes required to sprint at full intensity. Decreasing the length–tension curve of the hamstring muscles may place the athlete at increased injury risk. This is the postulated mechanism for the high rate of injuries in athletes that have had a previous hamstring injury."}

Groin injuries may be acute but often become chronic in nature. The most common location (\u000150%) of groin pain reported in athletes is the adductor muscle ten- don region. Acute onset pain in this region is com- monly attributable to an adductor longus muscle enthesopathy but may also be related to the ili- opsoas and or the abdominal muscles. The dif- ferential diagnosis for groin pain in athletes may include incipient hernia (also known as sports hernia or athletic hernia), adductor-related groin pain, abdominal muscle strain, hip joint etiol- ogy (i.e., labral tear, osteoarthritis, impingement), iliopsoas-related groin pain, fracture, nerve com- pression (i.e., obturator or lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment), or osteitis pubis (i.e., inﬂ am- mation often leading to sclerosis of the pubis sym- physis) (Figure 7.1). The unspeciﬁ c terms “osteitis pubis,” “pubalgia,” and “pubic bone stress” are sometimes used when a pathoanatomic diagno- sis cannot be made. Lesions to the lower abdomi- nal muscles and other structures associated to the inguinal canal can lead to a condition with some similarities of a hernia. The terms “sports hernia” and “incipient hernia” are commonly used. These refer to a condition of groin pain located to the lower part of the abdomen and to the upper and medial part of the groin region, often radiating to the medial thigh and across the pubic symphysis. Groin injury is among the top one to sixth most common cited injury in the Olympic sports of ice hockey, speed skating, soccer, and athletics."}

Key risk factors: how to identify athletes at risk Groin injury prevention strategies may be devel- oped and evaluated if there is a good understand- ing of the athlete population at risk, and the risk factors associated with injury for this population. Groin injury risk factors may be considered intrin- sic or extrinsic to the athlete (Table 7.2). These factors can be further identiﬁ ed as modiﬁ able or non-modiﬁ able. Modiﬁ able risk factors are those that can potentially be altered to reduce injury rates through the implementation of injury pre- vention strategies. There is evidence that modiﬁ - able risks such as decreased levels of sport-speciﬁ c training, endurance, strength, and balance do increase the risk of overall injury in sport.

Examples of non-modiﬁ able risk factors would be age, gender, and previous injury. Non-modiﬁ able intrinsic risk factors: previous injury There is evidence that previous groin injury con- sistently increases the risk of groin injury between 2.5- and 7-fold in both soccer and ice hockey. This is certainly also consistent with the evidence sup- porting previous injury as the key risk factor for many other injury types, including hamstring strain injury in elite athletes. This ﬁ nding is likely consistent with persistent symptoms, physiologi- cal deﬁ ciencies related to the initial injury (i.e., muscle strength, endurance, proprioception) and/ or inadequate rehabilitation. If the previous injury has not been sufﬁ ciently treated and the athlete returns to sport too early, that is, prior to all the physiological deﬁ ciencies being addressed, this could contribute to a reinjury for the athlete. This situation could perhaps occur because of insufﬁ - cient treatment or because of a wish from the ath- lete and/or the coach for an early return to sport. Other possible explanations for reinjury might be that a secondary muscular imbalance has occurred following the injury (or possibly prior to the injury that lead to the initial injury), that is, hip muscle strength ratios less than optimal or poor timing of torso muscle recruitment. If this secondary muscle imbalance is not addressed properly it may create a problem for the athlete upon return to sport.

Increasing age and sport experience as risk factors for groin injury may be rationalized by the idea that the body’s collagen tissue changes in its nature with advancing age and therefore it may not be as potentially adaptable to respond to quick force changes or recover from fatigue. Additionally, it has been shown that speciﬁ c muscle strength decreases with advancing age which may put these muscles more at risk for injury. There is consistency in the literature to support increased age as a risk factor for muscle strains in the hamstring and calf muscles. Decreased age and sport experience as a risk factor for groin injury in Australian Rules football players may be secondary to the study’s deﬁ nition of groin injury that included muscular and unspeciﬁ ed groin injuries such as osteitis pubis, differing from other studies that did not include osteitis pubis. In addition, studies ﬁ nding an increased risk with increasing age did not include players under age 18 and musculoskeletal immaturity may have played a role in the increased risk in junior Australian foot- ball players. Gender While there is a paucity of literature examining groin injury speciﬁ cally in female sport, gender has not been identiﬁ ed as a risk factor for groin strain injury. In varsity level ice hockey, gender was not found to be a risk factor for all injury or groin strain injury speciﬁ cally. Gender differences have more commonly been reported for ligament sprain injuries. Body composition Increased body mass index has been identiﬁ ed as a risk factor for groin injury in rugby players but not in any Olympic sports."}

This is not surprising given the unique eccentric adductor muscle activity and abduction ROM required in breast stroke kick compared to that in other strokes. Modiﬁ able intrinsic risk factors: range of motion Conﬂ icting evidence exists for the role of decreased hip abduction ROM as a risk factor for groin strain injury. In one study, a protective effect (10% risk reduction) related to greater hip abduc- tion and extension (i.e., players identiﬁ ed as being in the top 1/3 of players based on ﬂ exibility) in soccer players has been identiﬁ ed. However, there has been no evidence of hip abduction ROM as a risk factor for groin strain injury in other sports. A possible explanation between decreased ROM of the hip (as well as or in addition to decreased ROM of the lumbar spine and or pelvis) and groin injury may be that decreased ROM of the hip joints might lead to a change in the biomechanics related to sprinting, skating, tackling, kicking, and jumping. This could in turn lead to an increase of the load on the related muscles and tendons. An example could be decreased internal rotation of the hip joint leading to a need for changing the axis of rotation when kicking a ball or tackling. This would increase the load on the oblique mus- cles of the lower abdomen and thereby putting more stress on the conjoint tendon (i.e., where the tendons of the transverse abdominal muscle and the internal oblique muscle join and insert into the pubic tubercle). This could result in an inﬂ am- matory response and/or degeneration of the ten- don leading to pain by itself or to a strain, a tear, or an avulsion."}

Additionally, there is a growing body of evidence that is pointing toward stretch- ing being functional to the activity demands of the sport as well as the individual body concerns of the athlete. The contradiction in the evidence regard- ing the role of stretching in sport performance and injury prevention may be explained by differ- ences between sport activities. In sports involving “explosive” type skills, stretching may result in an increased capacity for the tendon to absorb energy and thereby be a prophylactic measure for injury prevention. The demands on different players (i.e., position of play) within the same sport may also differ, resulting in potentially divergent effects from the same ﬂ exibility program. The evidence- based debate regarding muscle ﬂ exibility and its role in injury prevention continues. A recent study of community level Australian football play- ers suggested that decreased quadriceps ﬂ exibility was an independent predictor of hamstring injury in this group of athletes. This ﬁ nding further fuels the discussion that it may not be adductor muscle length that is the important factor in groin injury prevention but rather the muscle length of its syn- ergistic and opposing muscles such as the abduc- tor and hip ﬂ exor muscles. Additionally, when traumatic osteitis pubis is considered as a poten- tial source of groin pain, a reduction hip range of motion (ROM) is demonstrated in athletes with chronic current and recovered groin injury. As insertional tendinopathy and osteitis pubis are often clinically difﬁ cult to diagnostically sepa- rate (and may even be the same injury where the changes in the pubic symphysis are a reﬂ ection of the increased stress across the joint because of the disturbed pelvic stability combined with the strain imposed by the sport itself), it may be that some studies on groin strain injury are including ath- letes with a past injury of osteitis pubis as study participants."}
{"id": "318", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Past injury has already been demon- strated to be a risk factor for groin strain injury and this could be confused with the role of hip ﬂ exibility as a risk factor for groin strain injury. Future work in the area of ﬂ exibility may shed new light on its importance with regard to injury prevention. Training background Decreased levels of pre-season sport-speciﬁ c train- ing was clearly a risk factor for groin strain injury in the National Hockey League, with players training less than 18 sport-speciﬁ c sessions in the pre-season demonstrating a threefold increase risk (Emery & Meeuwisse, 2001). An increase in pre-season sport- speciﬁ c training and a subsequent decrease in groin injury may be supported by eccentric training of the thigh muscles as well as abdominal supporting muscular training. Pre-season sport-speciﬁ c training may allow for further contraction and function- speciﬁ c recruitment of these muscles which might allow for their more effective utilization and less onset of fatigue as the season progresses. Fatigue has been noted in the literature to be a contribut- ing factor for muscle injury. Muscle strength and function With respect to hip muscle strength, while there was no evidence that peak isometric adduc- tor strength was a risk factor for groin injury in ice hockey, the adductor to abductor isometric strength ratio might be a risk factor for groin strain injury in ice hockey. In one study, the pre-season adductor strength was 18% less than the abductor strength in those players sustaining a subsequent groin injury, compared to those uninjured dur- ing the season (Tyler et al.,2002). In rugby players there has been some support for non-dominant limb peak abductor torque and peak torque later in abduction ROM with isokinetic testing being predictive for groin strain injury (Cusi et al.,"}
{"id": "319", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "2001). It is hypothesized that the mechanism of injury associated with groin injuries in ice hockey players is the eccentric force of the adductors attempting to decelerate the leg during a stride. A systematic review examining muscle strength as a risk fac- tor for acute muscle strain, also found decreased muscle strength and/or muscle ratios to be predic- tive of strain injury, consistent with the ﬁ ndings related to groin strain injury. It may be that the adductor strength (i.e., concentric and eccentric) throughout its length as well as the adductor to abductor strength ratio are important factors for injury prevention."}

A strength imbalance between the propulsive muscles and the stabilizing muscles of the hip and pelvis has been proposed as a mechanism for adductor strains in athletes. A large percentage of groin pain may actually be due to inability to properly load transfer from the legs and or torso to the pelvis. Restoring load transferability by restoration of the stabilizing role of the pelvis by abdominal contraction may be important in athletic injury management and pos- sibly injury prevention. There is some support for “core stability” interventions targeting abdominals and gluteals in reducing the risk of hamstring and groin injury in rugby players but further research is required to support these ﬁ ndings. Such ﬁ ndings lead to inquiry regarding the role of the muscles of the torso (i.e., transverse abdominus, obliques, diaphragm, multiﬁ dus, pelvic ﬂ oor) in stabilizing the pelvis such that the abductors and adductors can work explosively and not get strained. Perhaps it is the balance of all the torso muscles that is a critical factor in groin injury. It may be that the adductor strength (i.e., concentric and eccentric) throughout its length, with a balanced and strong torso, may be important for injury prevention. Risk factors beyond the groin region alone, including torso musculature, require further examination. The role of load transfer and torso stabilizing muscles, eccentric isokinetic strength including strength ratios of the adductors to abduc- tor muscles, and muscle length of the adductors and opposing muscle groups (i.e., abductor and hip ﬂ exor muscles) require further consideration."}

Inconsistent evidence exists regarding muscle strength as a risk factor for groin injury. Arguably, however, there is some evidence that hip adduc- tor:abductor strength ratio may be of importance. Additionally there is evidence that there are non- modiﬁ able risk factors that cannot be altered to reduce injury rates through the implementation of injury prevention strategies such as age or sport experience, gender, sport-speciﬁ c movement (i.e., breast stroke in swimming), and previous injury. An annual musculoskeletal preparticipation examination is often done by physiotherapists working with athletic teams to anticipate and pre- clude physiological and biomechanical problems for athletes prior to the commencement of a sport season activities. As such, the ultimate goal of such a preparticipation examination is injury preven- tion. Such a comprehensive examination should identify both the sport-speciﬁ c biomechanical and physiological requirements for training and com- petition, as well as when there are possible biome- chanical and physiological deﬁ cits that might be a precursor to injury. Preparticipation examinations consistently include athlete questionnaires includ- ing questions that might identify an increased risk for groin injury such as previous injury, levels of pre-season sport-speciﬁ c training, age or sport experience, gender, and sport-speciﬁ c movements (i.e., swimming stroke) (Table 7.3). In addition, standard neuro-musculoskeletal examinations and some form of functional testing are components of this preparticipation examination. The standard neuro-musculoskeletal examination which tests for strength in the form of isometric, concentric, and/or eccentric testing contribute to the identiﬁ cation of such strength ratios (i.e., hip adductor:abductor muscle strength ratio which is a potential risk factor for groin injury)."}

Functional performance tests for the sport in question are recommended for inclu- sion in a preparticipation examination. It is sug- gested that not only the clinical test outcome be scored (i.e., side lunge repetitions) but also the form and efﬁ ciency of the underlying functional movement involved in the test should be rated. For example, it is not only important to take note of the weight that an athlete can load with during a one-legged bench side step up test but how the ath- lete’s body was aligned during the test. As few vali- dated scoring systems exist the examiner is advised to develop scoring methodologies and to submit this scoring method to future research scrutiny. Upon recognition of potentially modiﬁ able risk factors by the physiotherapist, sport-speciﬁ c injury prevention strategies designed to reduce such risks can be implemented (Table 7.4 and Boxes 7.1–7.3). Injury mechanisms Acute versus chronic injury The injury mechanism associated with groin injuries is in many cases difﬁ cult to identify with certainty. Groin injury often has the characteris- tics of an overuse injury and the exact moment of injury (the inciting event) can be hard to establish. The typical history presented by the athlete with a groin injury comes in two versions: (1) 40% have experienced an acute painful incident during train- ing or competition or (2) 60% present with a grad- ually developing pain in the groin region often typical of an overuse injury.

Considering mechanism by structure injured The three most commonly mentioned structures involved in groin injury in the literature are the adductor muscles (usually adductor longus), the iliopsoas muscle, and the abdominal muscles. Decreased ROM of the hip joints, dysfunction of the sacroiliac joints, sacrotuberal ligaments, and low back are often seen concomitant to the muscle-related groin injuries. Their role in the both risk factors and a mechanism of groin injury is not clear (see Section “Key risk factors: how to identify athletes at risk”). When the adductor muscles are acutely strained it is often during an eccentric contraction (e.g., in a forced abduction, most likely when the limb is in some amount of abduction which is the posi- tion where this muscle is the weakest and as such more prone to sustain an injury) (Figure 7.2). This could be a sudden resistance of an opponent’s foot in an attempt to reach a ball or a sliding tackle in soccer or the eccentric force of the adductor muscles attempting to decelerate the leg during a stride in ice hockey. In many cases some degree of hip joint rotation is involved. It can also happen in a forceful concentric adduction contraction for instance in soccer during a kick after a ball in the air or as the result of a direct blunt trauma from contact with an opponent. The iliopsoas muscle, being a very important and strong hip ﬂ exor, can be acutely strained if a force- ful hip ﬂ exion is interrupted suddenly. This could happen when the player is tackled in the moment of a forceful hip ﬂ exion during running, skating, jumping, or kicking (Figure 7.3) or when by mis- take kicking into the ground instead of the ball."}

An acute strain of the lower abdominal muscles usually involves either the conjoint tendon (falx inguinalis) where the tendons of the transverse abdominal muscle and the internal oblique muscle join and insert into the pubic tubercle or the rectus abdominis muscle usually in the entheses at the pubic bone or in the distal myotendendinous junc- tion. The typical mechanism is a traumatic episode where the athlete over-stretches the front of the groin and lower abdomen as in a forceful sliding tackle in soccer or an uncontrolled fall backward where the hip is extended and the abdominal muscles are working hard to stop the fall by con- tracting with great speed and force, often with an eccentric contraction (Figure 7.4). The more rota- tion involved in the fall either in the hip joint or in the torso, the more likely it is the conjoint tendon that will sustain the lesion. In this situation the hip ﬂ exors (iliopsoas, rectus femoris, and tensor facia latae) are also at risk of sustaining an injury. Lesions to the lower abdominal muscles and other structures associated to the inguinal canal can lead to a condition with some similarities of a hernia (i.e., often called “sports hernia” or “incipient hernia”). A predisposition for her- nia development might be present, but the pri- mary mechanism of injury is probably an acute trauma as described earlier, or a period of overuse as a result of a misbalance of the muscles acting on the pelvis and an intense strenuous activity often involving exercises with many fast reactions including sprinting, jumping, kicking, and sudden changes of direction. The nature of the lesion is not always clear. It may be a strain or tear, inﬂ am- mation or degeneration at certain points of exces- sive stress, an avulsion, hemorrhage or edema.

These lumbar and pelvis stabi- lizing muscles are all constantly involved in most sports-activities contributing with a considerable amount of both eccentric and concentric work and fast changes between these work forms. This makes them highly important but are also at risk of sustaining an injury (Figure 7.5). The injury mechanism for developing groin injuries with an insidious onset has not been proven, but it seems reasonable that fatigue, over- use or acute overload of any of the muscles pre- viously discussed may lead to disturbance of the interaction between these muscles leaving some of the structures with loads exceeding their ability. This may in turn lead to injuries with structural damage to tissue and a need for repair. The ath- lete will often try to compensate for this situation and although they might succeed for a while, gradually the pain and loss of function will take over, and the athlete is not able to continue sport participation. The ability to react fast is impaired, and sudden changes of direction, sprinting and strenuous sudden abdominal contractions as when coughing and sneezing become painful. In some athletes this impaired pelvic stability put an increased stress on the symphysis joint lead- ing to a stress reaction that combined with the bony changes seen with the enthesopathy of the adductor longus insertion leads to an increased sig- nal when examined with bone scan and with MRI and to irregularities on X-ray. This is sometimes called “osteitis pubis like changes” as it looks like the changes seen with infection of the joint.

The transversus abdominis and the oblique abdominal muscles appear to contribute to a function not related to the direction of lower limb movement forces.

Perhaps it is the balance of all the torso, pelvis, and hip muscles that is a critical factor in groin injury. For example, weak posterior lumbar segmental multiﬁ dus muscles may lead to overused and resultant tight superﬁ - cial erector spinae muscles causing further poten- tial overuse of the adductor muscles as they try to stabilize and assist the anterior torso muscles, that is, abdominals (Figure 7.6). This situation might lead to strength through length issues of the adductor muscle group leading to further poten- tial for groin strain injury. Identifying risks in the training and competition program Groin injury prevention strategies may be devel- oped and evaluated if there is a good understanding of the athlete population at risk, and the risk factors associated with injury for this popula- tion (Table 7.4). Age and sports experience are factors that are in nature non-modiﬁ able, but it is tempting to assume, that if increasing age is a risk to sustain groin injury, focus should be to look for methods to take off load and programs that could strengthen the speciﬁ c structures, that most frequently are injured in the “mature” ath- letes. If on the other hand decreased age and/or sports experience are risk factors, care must be taken to implement preventive programs for this group, probably including both speciﬁ c strength- ening as well as exercises for pelvic stability and educating the young athletes (and their coaches) in using common sense in the progression of sport speciﬁ c training and in handling exercise related pain. Sport speciﬁ city has been shown to be a risk factor in swimmers, who are at a risk of getting adductor-related groin problems, if they are breast- stroke specialists.

To prevent sport speciﬁ city related groin injuries development of modiﬁ ed techniques that decrease the load on the speciﬁ c structures could probably decrease the risk of groin injury. Another way would be to strengthen the structures at risk. Too few sessions of pre-season sport speciﬁ c training have been shown to be a risk factor in ice hockey. This is probably a reﬂ ection of an increased risk of sustaining an injury when par- ticipating in sports at a higher level and a higher intensity that you are generally ﬁ t for. An increase in pre-season sport-speciﬁ c training and a subse- quent decrease in groin injury may be supported by eccentric training of the thigh muscles as well as abdominal supporting muscular training. Pre- season sport-speciﬁ c training may allow for fur- ther contraction and function-speciﬁ c recruitment of these muscles, which might allow for their more effective utilization and less onset of fatigue as the season progresses. Fatigue has been noted in the literature to be a contributing factor for mus- cle injury. As the research data available does not adequately differentiate training and competition groin strain injury one can only insert a “clini- cal opinion” here. Clinically, there appears to be three main time frames that groin strains appear to be more likely."}
{"id": "351", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "These times are during the pre- season training when heavy training loads are being done, during the ﬁ rst competitions of the year for explosive speed sports, that is, sprinters and during the last half of the competition year for endurance type sports. Adequate pre-season and continued through season assessment and training of hip ROM as well as hip muscle strength/muscle balance and torso muscle recruitment timing may further minimize the risk of groin injuries. Preventive measures A number of more or less well-established risk factors have been mentioned earlier in this chap- ter (previous groin injury, age, sport experience, sport speciﬁ city, pre-season sport speciﬁ c train- ing, hip ROM, hip muscle strength, and abdomi- nal muscle recruitment), unfortunately there are very few studies that have examined the effect of possible preventive measures (Table 7.4). This section will summarize “best practices” for groin injury prevention in sport, considering the lim- ited but best evidence available identifying risk factors and prevention strategies for groin injury to date. Globally, development of a sport-spe- ciﬁ c prevention strategy to reduce the risk of groin injury in sport will include components of adequate rehabilitation for previous injury, early identiﬁ cation of sport-speciﬁ c ROM and strength deﬁ cits, and achieving sport-speciﬁ c ROM and strength as well as muscle timing of recruitment requirements. Adequate rehabilitation of previous injuries Previous groin injury is one of the best established risk factors and it is generally considered a non- modiﬁ able factor. However, despite the fact that a previous injury has occurred and this in itself is non-modiﬁ able, there are other related factors that are highly relevant and potentially modiﬁ able. These factors may include how this injured ath- lete was treated, if there was speciﬁ c treatment for the injury, if the treatment was functional for the demands of the athlete, and if the athlete returned to the sport including competition with complete rehabilitation of this injury (i.e., full pain free and functional ROM regained, full strength on resisted testing, concentric and eccentric muscle speciﬁ c function retrained). It is important to use speciﬁ c treatment methods that treat both the dysfunc- tion related to the speciﬁ c structural damage that caused the groin pain (i.e., adductor tendon enthe- ses as well as to restore associated pelvic muscular instability by retraining the muscles of the torso as well as the muscles of the hip and pelvis). It is not enough to treat a damaged tendon insertion with steroid injections and time off from the sport and then return when the pain is gone."}
{"id": "352", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Likewise, only treating with “core stability” exercises to stimulate the abdominal and low back muscles and then return to sport is not a sufﬁ cient treatment and rehabilitation of a damaged tendon insertion to prevent recurrence of the groin injury."}
{"id": "353", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Preventing groin injuries 111 To prevent recurrence of previous groin injuries, treatment aiming at healing the structural damage should be combined with an exercise program to re-establish the pelvic stability and a rehabilita- tion program gradually including the demands and skills needed to participate in the particular sport before allowing the athlete to return to full participation. Otherwise there is a risk that the factors that originally led to the structural damage will again “take over” and combined with fatigue because of lack of sport-speciﬁ c rehabilitation may eventually lead to groin re-injury and as often encountered a risk of other injuries as well. Increasing hip ROM The ROM of the hip joint is suggested as a risk factor for groin injuries. There are many reasons for pathologic changes of the hip joint ROM, some of which are easily modiﬁ able whereas oth- ers are more difﬁ cult. Acquired tightness of the rotators, ﬂ exors, extensors, abductors or adduc- tors of the hip joint are all potentially able to be loosened with stretching exercises, soft tissue release techniques (manual therapy, massage, dry needling, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilita- tion techniques), as well as balanced muscle train- ing addressing both the affected muscles and the antagonist muscles. One study found an increased hip abduction ROM after an exercise program including both concentric and eccentric adductor exercises but no stretching exercises for the adduc- tor muscles. Generally there is no evidence that stretching can prevent groin injuries. However there are indications that a normal ROM of the muscles and joints probably is important. In Box 7.1 some stretching exercises for the muscles around the hip joint are described. Capsular tightness of the hip joint can be found due to post-injury ﬁ brosis reaction, as the result of adaptation to decreased ROM for other reasons dur- ing long periods of time or as an inherent general capsular tightness."}
{"id": "354", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "The collagen tissue in the cap- sule is probably possible to stimulate to adaptation to a larger ROM with exercises and manual therapy. Decreased ROM of the hip joint related to bony abnormalities is another and much more difﬁ cult problem to treat. Dysplasia of the hip joint can be found in a number of variations and many of these include abnormalities in the ROM of the hip joints, in most cases reducing ROM. In the last decade more attention has been given to the impingement problems of the hip joint. This problem includes groin pain and in most cases some degree of decreased ROM of the hip joint. The two most prominent impingement diag- noses are known as Cam impingement and Pincer impingement. In both cases bony abnormali- ties lead to potentially further structural damage to the hip joint. They can both be found in ath- letes without groin or hip pain but with decreased ROM of the hip joints and potentially they are probably a risk factor for developing groin pain. If the impingement problem is symptomatic with hip joint and groin pain, damage to the acetabular cartilage as well as to the labrum of the hip joint is often found. These osseous hip problems need in most cases to be treated surgically if symptomatic, followed by a closely monitored rehabilitation program to re-establish muscle strength and coor- dination related to the pelvis."}

It is not clear, whether any prevention is indicated in cases of pain-free impingement, but theoretically there is a risk, that these patients develop groin injury and intra-articular damage of the hip joint. How these athletes should be advised regarding further sports activities is not clear and is currently a subject for discussion and ongoing scientiﬁ c studies. Strength training The strength of the abductor and the adductor muscles have been debated as possible risk fac- tors earlier in this chapter. One study suggests that the ratio between adductors and abductors are important and that pre-season strength train- ing of the adductor muscles in ice hockey play- ers with adductor/abductor strength ratio \u000480% could decrease the number of adductor related groin injuries (Tyler et al.,2002).

If, however, we also consider the protective effect of pre-season sport- speciﬁ c training in ice hockey, this also has impli- cations for supporting eccentric adductor strength activity to reduce the risk of groin injury. The combination of strengthening of the adduc- tors and the abductors with abdominal and low back muscle recruitment is probably the area where some of the most likely possibilities are available. A randomized treatment study including speciﬁ c train- ing of the adductor muscles (static, concentric, and eccentric), as well as exercises for the muscles related to the pelvis including the core stability principles, showed a highly signiﬁ cant effect in the treatment of adductor-related groin injuries (Hölmich et al.,1999). In another randomized controlled trial including 1022 male soccer players, the possible preventive value of such an exercise program has been exam- ined. The exercises (Box 7.2) consisted of the follow- ing: (1) static isometric adduction exercises squeezing a soccer ball between the feet and between the knees in the supine position, (2) dynamic adductor and abductor strengthening exercises (concentric and eccentric) done with a partner, (3) coordination of the hip joint related muscles and the muscles of the torso using a dynamic exercise combining sit-up, hip ﬂ exion and adduction, (4) dynamic propriocep- tive exercise stimulating both concentric and eccen- tric strength utilizing the principles of core stability (i.e., including the muscles of the torso as well as the muscles of the lower extremities), and (5) stretching exercises for the iliopsoas muscle given the nature of secondary involvement of this muscle in the pres- ence of groin pain. The trial found that the risk of sustaining a groin injury was decreased 31%, but the difference was not statistically signiﬁ cant. Despite the inconclusiveness of this study, the 31% reduc- tion in the risk of getting a groin injury would be a considerable advantage, which probably would make it worth while for the soccer players to do the program. Take-home message The best means to identify an athlete at risk for a groin injury may be for the athlete to undergo a preparticipation physiotherapy examination."}

This has led to a common opinion that high doses of training for long periods of time at a young age are required in order to become an elite athlete. Historically, this has resulted in a trend to start training, com- petition and specialization in one sport at a very young age. This means that many sports require training with high intensity and with high load, often from a very young age. In many sports, it has been found that athletic training with the aim of perfection requires monotonous and repetitive strenuous exercises, leading to an increased risk of musculoskeletal morbidity and/or disturbed growth. A result of this is that overuse injuries are an increasing problem in sports and have also been more noticed among young athletes. It has also been shown that the growing spine is highly vulnerable to trauma, especially during the adolescent growth spurt (Baranto et al.,2006). In many sports, such as gymnastics, wrestling, and weight lifting, the growing spine is exposed to high loads and in some situations to extreme loads.

The lifetime prevalence of low back pain in wrestlers has been reported to 59%; signiﬁ - cantly higher than that of an age-matched control group (31%). A signiﬁ cantly higher frequency of low back pain has also been reported in elite gym- nasts (79%) than in controls (37%) (Swärd et al., 1991). In a prospective study of 134 former top athletes with mean age 33.2 years, it was found that wrestlers had the highest frequency of severe low back pain (54%) as compared to tennis play- ers (32%), soccer players (36%), female and male gymnasts (29%), and non-athletes (32%) (Lundin et al.,2001)."}

It was found that disc degeneration was not a precursor to lumbar stress changes, but individu- als with bilateral stress fractures had severe disc degeneration in all fast bowlers who had a chronic bilateral L5 stress fracture. It was also showed that acute bony stress can be reliably identiﬁ ed using an MRI. An MRI can also detect other structures associated with low lumbar injury, such as intervertebral discs, facet joints, lumbar muscles, and ligaments to be injured (Ranson et al., 2005). Spondylolysis Spondylolysis is a radiological diagnosis and means a defect within the bone of the posterior part of neural arch, that is, pars interarticula- ris. The frequency of spondylolysis in the gen- eral population is found to be 4–6% (Figure 8.3). However, the incidence in athletes is much higher, especially in athletes with low back pain where, in one of these studies, spondylolysis was found in 47% of the cases (Sassmannshausen & Smith, 2002).

Anatomy and function of the spine Development of the spine The vertebral column consists of a series of linked segments, which serve as the main supporting structure of the body. It also allows sufﬁ cient phys- iological motion between the body parts and also protects the spinal cord from damaging forces. The spine is composed of vertebrae, intervertebral discs, facet joints, ligaments, and muscles. Figure 8.3. Schematic and CT scan showing spondylolysis.

The vertebra consists of the vertebral body and the neural arch containing transverse, articular, and spinous processes. The growth of vertebral bodies proceeds from the osseous surface of the cartilagi- nous epiphyseal plates that cover the end plates. These growth plates are, unlike the growth plates of the long bones, not covered by a bony epiphy- seal plate. At the periphery of the epiphyseal end- plates, in the growing vertebrae, there are recesses where the vertebral ring apophyses are formed. They are the insertion site for the annulus ﬁ brosus of the discs. The area between the ring apophyses and the vertebral body are the weakest part of the spine during growth. The ring apophysis starts to ossify at about 13 years of age and begins to fuse with the vertebral body at about 17 years of age. At completed growth, each vertebra has an elevated rim and a central depression of the endplates. The etiology and development of intervertebral disc degeneration and abnormalities affecting the vertebral endplates and ring apophyses are not fully known."}

As evidenced by the high frequency of abnormalities in the spine of adolescent athletes, mechanical trauma at a young age appears to be a factor of importance especially in sports with great demands on the back (Jackson, 1979; Swärd et al.,1990; Goldstein et al.,1991; Lundin et al.,2001; Baranto et al., 2006). Little is known about the biomechanics and strength of the degenerated disk. In an experi- mental study, a degenerative disc was created by drilling a hole through the cranial endplate of a lumbar vertebra into the disc. The results in this study were that twice the axial load was required to create failure of the degenerated discs as com- pared to non-degenerated discs. Muscles of the lumbar spine For descriptive purposes, the spine muscles may be divided into three groups: superﬁ cial, intermedi- ate, and deep."}

The muscles quadratus lumborum, iliopsoas and the abdominal muscles are also important lumbar spine muscles. Core stability/neuromuscular control The term stability is a mechanical concept that most be relate to, but which can be difﬁ cult to explain when applied to the body in motion. The term is borrowed from traditional mechanics and describes the ability of a body to remain in the same position while forces are being exerted on it. However, when performing in sports, body conﬁ guration is rarely static; in fact, it constantly and rapidly changes. Thus, the athlete must be sufﬁ ciently stable and at the same time mobile in order to adapt to the demands placed on them during various movement patterns. The stability and mobility of a joint is pri- marily dependent on three factors: passive structures (bones, ligaments, joint capsules), active structures (muscles), and the ability to successfully coordinate information and activate the muscles (the central and peripheral nervous system) (Figure 8.4).

This ability is also often referred to as neu- romuscular (motor) control. In training terminology this is often referred to as stability, and when refer- ring to the low back pelvis and hip region, “core stability.”Based on recent research, it has become common to categorize the muscles according to their func- tion and location in the body. More simply put, the deep paraspinal muscles, with high endurance and ﬁ ne motor skills, stabilize the joint systems (here the lower back, pelvis, and hip), whereas the super- ﬁ cial muscles, with less endurance, produce pro- pulsion. The larger the forces produced, the greater the importance of the ability to stabilize, both for the effective utilization of muscle activity (effective technique), and for preventing injuries. Thus, the paraspinal muscles can have a direct inﬂ uence on segmental stability and control of the lumbar spine due to their attachments to the spinal column. Coordinated contraction of the lumbar paraspinal muscles with the abdominal wall muscles is thought to have a stabilizing effect on the lumbar spinal seg- ments, and therefore providing a safe platform for trunk movement. Dysfunction of these muscles has been suggested to be a signiﬁ cant risk factor in the etiology and chronicity of low back pain. Key risk factors: how to identify athletes at risk Improper technique Improper sport technique and weak abdominal and leg muscles have been shown to increase the risk for spinal injuries."}

(1991) found that only 21% of athletes using proper technique and did not overtrain had degenerative ﬁ ndings in the spine, compared to 62% of athletes using improper technique and overtraining. Posture Lower back pain has a strong relationship to pos- ture and it is well known that poor posture is often a result of muscular imbalance. This imbalance can cause low back pain during training cycles and sports competition. Ideal posture, analyzed from the side, has been described as the perfect distri- bution of weight around the center of gravity in which the agonist and antagonist muscles should be in perfect balance regarding ﬂ exibility and strength. Perfect muscular balance in relation to posture will provide for optimum efﬁ ciency dur- ing movement of sports and daily activities. This perfect balance is however difﬁ cult to achieve. Hyperlordosis or excessive curvature of the lower spine Another cause of low back pain in adolescent ath- letes is hyperlordosis or a lordotic lumbar back, which is most commonly due to a forward tilting of the pelvis (Sassmannshausen & Smith, 2002). Forward tilting of the pelvis causes high loads on the intervertebral discs and the facet joints, result- ing in high stress in the pars interarticularis of the neural arc of the lower lumbar spine. It was found in a study on young athletes that the sacro-horizontal angle was larger in athletes with spondylolysis as compared to those without."}
{"id": "377", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "They, therefore, suggested that an increased sacro- horizontal angle may predispose the individual to spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis, especially in combination with the high mechanical loads sus- tained in certain sports. The posture of a forward tilting pelvis causes an increase in the effective curve of the spine. The pathomechanism behind hyperlordosis in chil- dren is that the thoracolumbar fascia becomes tight during the adolescent growth spurt due to more rapid growth of the axial skeleton than the fascia. The thoracolumbar fascia consists of three layers of fascia that envelop the muscles of the lumbar spine, effectively separating them into three compartments. Pathologic tightness occurs when the skeletal growth exceeds the capacity of the soft tissues to remain limber. This tightness may cause traction apophysitis at the iliac crest and spinous processes or impingement of adja- cent spinous processes. The risk factors are rapid growth and sports that require strong hamstrings, which could exacerbate tightness. The symptoms caused by hyperlordosis are activity-related low back pain."}

As the degeneration of the disc starts early in life the elasticity decreases, after the growth spurt the disc will therefore quickly become stiffer. The degenerative changes found in adoles- cence in divers may be related to acute spine inju- ries occurring during the pubertal growth spurt early in the athletic career (Baranto et al.,2006). The results from the several studies suggest that degenerative changes are common among young elite athletes and that trauma to the thoracolum- bar spine during the growth spurt is particularly harmful (Goldstein et al.,1991; Kujala et al.,1996; Baranto et al.,2006). The degenerative changes are probably caused by repeated acute injuries, which earlier in the literature has been reported to be of etiological importance for the early degenerative process in lumbar spine among athletes, rather than several years of heavy loading on the spine (Hellström et al.,1990; Goldstein et al.,"}

In divers, the abnormalities were found from the age of 12 years and deterioration was found in only one of the divers under 16 years, but in 73% of those over 16 years (Baranto et al., 2006). This supports the statement that degenera- tive abnormalities occur at early age, probably due to acute injuries, and deterioration of the abnor- malities is due to the duration of heavy loading on the spine. Although there are clearly sports which put the child and adolescent spine at high risk of inju- ries, such as gymnastics and competitive diving, it would be expected that the risk of low back prob- lems increases with age as degenerative changes become more prevalent. When examining groups of adult competitive athletes in sports character- ized by repetitive low back ﬂ exion (cross-country skiing) or extension (rowing) loads, age is an inde- pendent risk factor for injury. In fact, the risk of reporting low back pain within a 12-month period increases by 19% for every 5-year increase in age."}

Women were 35% more likely to report low back pain epi- sodes during the previous 12 months than men. Previous injury It has been found that spondylolysis increases the risk for disc degeneration. It has also been shown that back pain results in decreased muscle volume and strength. Therefore a thorough rehabilitation is mandatory after every episode of back pain or back injury. Typical injury mechanisms: examples from high-risk sports Acute trauma or repetitive stress Acute macro-trauma, repetitive micro-trauma/ stress, or a combination of these two mechanisms can result in spine injuries in adolescent athletes, resulting in low back pain (Jackson, 1979; Swärd et al.,1991). Repetitive bending (e.g., in gymnas- tics and diving) and twisting (e.g., in tennis and baseball) of the back increases the risk for spinal injuries in athletes.

Loading patterns associated with injury A combination of different kinds of load is respon- sible for injuries in the spine of athletes. A single load may cause a speciﬁ c injury, but in the major- ity of injuries there are combinations of loads. Heavy loads on the growing spine are the key risk factor for causing injuries in young athletes. The following describes the different loading patterns on the athletic spine. Compression loads Compression loads may cause injury of the intervertebral disc (degeneration, low signal inten- sity on MRI), the ring apophysis, and the endplate (growth abnormalities such as Schmorl’s nodes and Scheuermann’s disease). During various athletic activities, high loads are produced on the spine and every different sport places unique demands on the spine (Bono, 2004)."}

In another study, the average com- pression loads measured were \u000117,000 N in the L4–L5 disc in competitive weightlifters (Table 8.2). Cappozzo et al.found in a similar study that when a person performed half-squat exercises with weights \u00011.6 times the body weight, the compression forces across the L3–L4 disc were about 10 times the body weight. In these studies, the authors found that increasing lumbar ﬂ exion was the most inﬂ uential factor affecting compressive loads (Bono, 2004). In several studies we have analyzed the strength of the vertebral functional complex and also described the injury pattern at overload. In radiographic and MRI studies it has been found abnormalities that can be explained by these experiments, for example, the over representation of vertebral growth disturbances found in athletes in the thoracolumbar junction. The most probable explanation for this is that the loads are highest in the anterior part of the vertebral bodies resulting in an injury to the area of the ring apophyses and that the energy in a rotation overload, due to the brute change in facet joint orientation in the lower thoracic spine from allowing to restricting rotation, is transformed from the stable facet joints to the mobile weaker anterior part of the vertebrae. This causes an injury affecting the ring apophysis and thereby a disturbance growth, resulting in wedged vertebrae and a Scheuermann kyfosis, which is also called traumatic form of Scheuermann’s disease. Alexander (1977) suggested in the 1970s that abnormalities such as endplate changes, Schmorl’s nodes, apophyseal ring fractures and abnormal conﬁ guration of the vertebral body are trau- matic forms of Scheuermann’s disease and a com- mon ﬁ nding in athletes."}

The extension movements in the intervertebral joints behave conversely to movements in ﬂ exion. The vertebral bodies rotate posteriorly and also undergo a small posterior translation in the sagittal plane. In addition to the tension in the disc, exten- sion movement is resisted by bony impact between the spinous and articular processes, the laminae and also by the capsule of the facet joint. The poste- rior ligaments are not critical for limiting extension. However, the well-developed anterior longitudinal ligament and the anterior portion of the annulus ﬁ brosus and the facet joints are important inhibi- tors of hyperextension and posterior translation. In an experimental study performed on func- tional spinal units from adolescent male pigs, which were exposed to ﬂ exion–compression or extension– compression loading to failure, fractures/separations were seen in the growth zone anteriorly and more frequently, posteriorly in spines exposed to ﬂ exion– compression. In extension–compression such inju- ries occurred only anteriorly. In another experi- mental study we found that the experimentally degenerative discs in the ﬂ exion–compression group required four times more compression load before failure than normal adolescent spine units, while the degenerated extension–compression group required only 60% more load than normal.

The facet joints play a great role in maintain- ing the stability of the lumbar spine in ﬂ exion. To understand these mechanisms it is important to recognize that ﬂ exion involves both anterior sagit- tal rotation and anterior sagittal translation (Figure 8.5). During ﬂ exion, the highest pressure is recorded at the antero-medial part of the lumbar facet joint. Each facet joint capsule, acting as a ligament, can resist about 600 N and the tension developed in it during ﬂ exion is enough to bend the inferior artic- ular processes downward and forward about 5º. During ﬂ exion, the weight of the trunk exerts com- pressive and shear forces on the intervertebral disc, which are proportional to the angle of inclination of the inter-body joint. Rotation compression Rotation compression loads also cause injury of the intervertebral disc, the ring apophysis, the endplate and of the facet joints. Rotation of the lumbar spine involves torsion of the intervertebral discs and the impact of the facet joints.

Flexion and extension bending occur in most diving maneuvers and axial loading, shearing and torsional stresses act through multiple spinal segments, creating a potential for injuries (Badman & Rechtine, 2004). The injury mechanism is related to the takeoff, ﬂ ight and the entry phases, and each phase can cause different spine injuries (Badman & Rechtine, 2004). The average entry speed into the water is between 8.4 m/s (1 m springboard) and 14.0 m/s (10 m springboard). At impact a speed reduction of more than 50% within a fraction of a second has been demonstrated, resulting in tremendous axial load on the spine creating signiﬁ cant potential for injuries.

As well as protecting the spine against ﬂ exion injuries the increased paraspinal mus- culature causes an unbalanced hyperextension force, which puts the pars interarticularis at great risk. The etiology of lumbar stress injury in fast bowl- ers in cricket has been shown to be multifacto- rial. Asymmetrical development of the paraspinal musculature, particularly quadratus lumborum, was associated to lumbar stress injuries in elite fast cricket bowlers. The lumbar spine was found to be the most com- monly injured site in swimmers, divers, and water polo players and synchronized swimmers. Freestyle and backstroke increase lumbar segmental axial rotation and therefore increase torque forces most, which puts the annulus ﬁ brosus at risk for injury. Top swimmers are at an increased risk for injuries because of exaggerated movements that increase ﬂ ex- ion and extension. The lumbar facet pain increases with strokes that accentuate lumbar spine extension, such as breaststroke and butterﬂ y. Finally, in supine swimming extension of the cervical spine induces lumbar extension, resulting in increased stress on the pars interarticularis and the facet joints."}

Goldstein et al.

In contradiction to these ﬁ nd- ings, Lundin et al. (2001) found, in a study of elite athletes representing wrestling, gymnastics, soccer, and tennis, that the athletes did not report more back pain than non-athletes (all athletes 60%, non- athletes 61%, female gymnasts 67%), despite signif- icantly more radiological changes. The difference between these two studies may be due to the fact that in the study by Goldstein et al. (1991) the ath- letes were younger (mean age in female gymnasts 16.6 years) and still active in their sport, while in the study by Lundin et al. (2001) the individu- als were older (mean age in female gymnasts 30.6 years, all athletes 33.1 years) and they were mostly former, rather than active, elite athletes. Goldstein et al. (1991) found that 57% of the gymnasts who trained 15 h or more per week had degenerative changes on MRI, as compared to 13% in those who trained less, and they concluded that the amount of training is of importance for the development of spinal injuries."}

Many of the sport injuries are the result of inadequate training, pore technique, but also structural anatomical weaknesses in the body. Unfortunately, there is a lack of scientiﬁ cally docu- mented prevention methods for preventing spinal injuries in athletes. The following are best-practice recommendations based on our current under- standing of risk factors and injury mechanisms discussed earlier. Only when critical motion patterns and loads in speciﬁ c sports can be identiﬁ ed, prevention may be possible. In order to avoid harmful motion patterns, rules and regulations, as well as scoring systems in esthetic sports, may have to be modi- ﬁ ed. Since sport rules and regulations usually have historical origin and governing bodies tend to be very protective regarding new or modiﬁ ed age- related rules in sports, considerable efforts and convincing evidence will be needed in order to implement modiﬁ cations of rules and regulations when needed. Presently, little scientiﬁ c evidence of this kind is available. Until such information is available, prevention must be based on indirect evidence, such as the overrepresentation of certain injuries in a sport. Thus, more general restrictions can be applied, for example, appropriate (biological) age limits for advanced muscular strength training with weights, limitations of repetitions of strenuous activities at a young age, and avoidance of inappro- priate exercises that carry increased risk of injury."}

Medical personnel, includ- ing physicians and physical therapists, need to take a more active role in preventing sports inju- ries, by educational and other activities at all lev- els, including young athletes. As described in the earlier section the spine is in great risk for injuries due to extreme loads on the spine in axial compression, hyperﬂ ex- ion and hyperextension bending, rotation, and ﬁ nally a combination of the loads. It is also well documented that the spine is most vulnerable to trauma during the growth spurt. Furthermore, the amount of training and competition is of great importance for overuse injuries of the spine in athletes. To prevent spinal injuries the most important factor is to avoid high loads on the spine of athletes before the spine is fully grown, which means at least until after the age of 18 years. It is also important to avoid extreme bend- ing movements of the spine in sports when it is possible, even if this is probably not realistic in many sports. The amount of training is of funda- mental importance to reduce and avoid overuse injuries on the spine in athletes. Competition schedules should also be adjusted to the biologic age of the athletes. Young athletes should concen- trate on coordination, techniques, and balance before the growth spurt."}

The athlete with back pain must have a rehabili- tation concentrating on technique, ﬂ exibility, and muscle control to withstand the high demands of their sport. Prevention principles On the basis of our current understanding of risk factors and injury mechanisms, the following four principles are recommended to prevent back problems: 1.

The player will be particularly at risk if the hip ﬂ exors are short, causing reduced mobility in the extension of the thoracic spinal column. A large part of the strain is thus put on the lower back. In order to pre- vent problems in athletes like this, it is important to strengthen the lower abdominal muscles and increase mobility in the hip and thoracic spine. Another example is cross-country skiing, where many athletes also have lower back problems (Bahr et al.,2004). One reason for this may be unfavorable technique in the double-pole push, where the athlete moves too far forward, causing extreme ﬂ exion in the lower back. This places a strain on the back, especially if the athlete does not have sufﬁ cient strength and stability in the back/pelvis and hips. A shorter forward motion, where the back is kept in more of a mid-position is likely to both prevent injuries and be a more efﬁ - cient technique. The selection of exercises to prevent low back problems should reﬂ ect the demands of the sport, designed to enable the athlete to meet the bio- mechanical demands placed on the lower back."}

Awareness exercises 2. Stability training/neuromuscular control 3. Dynamic strength training of the muscles in the abdomen and back. Awareness exercises (Box 8.1) Awareness exercises are intended to improve con- trol of the pelvic area in order to ﬁ nd a favorable position for the lower back. The objective is to make the athlete aware of the position and angle of the pelvis, to avoid putting the spinal column in a position where it is at increased risk for inju- ries. The term pelvic position denotes the position of the pelvis in relation to the other body sections. The position of the pelvis may be changed with- out changing the curvature of the back. If the pel- vis is tilted forward, lumbar lordosis will increase."}
{"id": "401", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "The pelvic angle and the curvature of the spine are thus interrelated. This may be inﬂ uenced by mobility and strength in the muscles of the back, abdomen, and hip joint. Control of the pelvic region is critically important, since it represents the center of the transfer of force between the upper body and the legs. Stability training/neuromuscular control (Box 8.2) Neuromuscular control training (often referred to as “core stability” training) aims to make the athlete able to maintain a favorable position for the lower back, pelvic area, and hip area dur- ing various loading conditions. By maintaining a favorable position, the impact on the tissues and structures of the lower back is reduced. The exercises are also well suited for reveal- ing reduced neuromuscular control and reduced strength in the muscles (“weak links”). The term “weak link” denotes a weak point in a muscle syn- ergy. The objective of core stability exercises is to optimize control and force transfer in the lower back, pelvis, and hips with the least amount of force lost and the least amount of strain on the back. There are several different ways of training sta- bility/neuromuscular control. Studies have shown that two effective ways of improving/restoring neuromuscular control is to: 1."}

Any training in an open kinetic chain, such as knee extension, is effective for isolating a certain muscle group, but less effective to develop neuromuscular control.

Exercises focusing on the lower parts of the abdo- men and back are particularly important. In order to be able to tolerate the loads athletes are exposed to, good muscle strength, and muscle endurance in these regions are important. Increased muscle strength results from two mechanisms: 1. Muscle ﬁ ber hypertrophy, that is, increasing the cross-sectional area of the muscles.2. Nervous adaptation, that is, activating more muscle ﬁ bers, faster activation and more simultaneous activation. When a new strength exercise program is started, the initial strength increase over the ﬁ rst few weeks is almost exclusively due to nervous adaptation. Hypertrophy occurs later, and in order to maximize hypertrophy, sub-maximal loads (60–90% of maxi- mal load) with 8–12 repetitions in several series (often 4–6) until exhaustion is recommended."}
{"id": "418", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Movements are performed relatively slowly, partic- ularly in the eccentric phase. Increased muscle strength based on nerv- ous adaptation occurs when several muscle ﬁ b- ers are activated simultaneously, particularly the fast-twitch ﬁ bers, which are harder to activate than slow-twitch ﬁ bers. In order to activate the highest possible number of motor units, it is criti- cal that the athlete attempts to execute the motion as fast as possible. The same principles apply to the muscles in the abdomen and back. However, for this region one must consider both anatomi- cal and mechanical factors in order to avoid excess strain and injuries resulting from the exercises themselves. Many atheletes have problems achieving the intended strength increase in the lower part of the abdominal muscles. This may be due to the fact that many atheletes worry about injuring their back during exercises intended to strengthen the muscles in their abdomen and back. Therefore, they are cautious during abdominal exercises, tak- ing particular care not to activate the hip ﬂ exors. What appears to be the most common abdominal exercise is the “sit-up” without securing the legs, lifting the shoulder blades off the ground. This exercise does not sufﬁ ciently challenge the mus- cles of the abdomen, back, and hip area, and this particular area requires a strong muscle corset."}

Studies have revealed a connection between changes in neuromuscular control mechanisms and back problems. Changes in the recruitment patterns for both abdominal and back muscles are apparent in most back pain patients, irrespective of the cause of the prob- lems. Muscular dysfunction in low back pain has been described for both the deep and the super- ﬁ cial muscle systems. Locally, it is expressed as a dysfunction in the recruitment and control of deep segmental stabilizing muscles (Hides et al., 1996; Hodges & Richardson, 1996; O’Sullivan et al.,1997; Jull & Richardson, 2000). Dysfunction in the local muscle system in low back pain patients has been shown to include segmental atrophy of deep layers of the lumbar multiﬁ dus muscles on the painful side (Hides et al.,1994). This appears soon after acute low back pain, and will not automatically normalize when pain sub- sides."}

Some studies show good effects on lower back pain from targeted exercises of the muscular sup- port system in the lumbar vertebral column, including the transverse abdominis, lumbar multi- ﬁ dii, and pelvic ﬂ oor muscles. The aim is to isolate the function of these muscles, creating a stabiliz- ing “corset” of “deep stabilizing muscles.”This has proven to be beneﬁ cial both in the short and in the long run in terms of improved function and decreased pain, and such training is probably criti- cal to avoid reinjuries in athletes with a history of low back pain, although this hypothesis has not been tested in formal trials. Take-home message It is important to be aware of the weakness of the growing spine and the relation to the growth spurt. To prevent spinal injuries the most impor- tant factor is to avoid high loads on the spine of athletes before the spine is fully grown, which means at least until after the age of 18. It is also important to avoid extreme bending move- ments of the spine in sports whenever possible. Competition programs should also take the age of the athletes into account. The amount of training is of fundamental importance to reduce and avoid overuse injuries on the spine in athletes. The young athletes ought to concentrate on coordination, techniques, and balance before the growth spurt."}

Epidemiology of shoulder injuries in sports Shoulder injuries are common in sports and can be traumatic, microtraumatic, or overuse in origin. Detailed information on the prevention of shoul- der injurie is lacking, however. According to a study in the United States, of the general population, shoulder injuries accounted for 8.1% of all sports injuries. Of these, 9.4% precluded participation on at least one occasion, 5.7% precluded participation for at least 1 month, and 10.7% resulted in the par- ticipant giving up the sport permanently. Therefore, the potential to prevent shoulder injuries should be optimized, and some chronic overuse-related inju- ries, as well as acute injuries, may be avoided. Table 9.1 provides an overview of available epi- demiological data on shoulder injuries in sports. Baseball and softball account for the highest per- centage of shoulder injuries, relative to other locations in the body, and these tend to be overuse injuries. In the United States, it has been estimated that 18% of all injuries in baseball to people over 6 years of age who play are to the shoulder, second only to elbow injuries. It is estimated that 5.8 shoul- der injuries occur per 100 participants a year."}

In tennis, the general annual incidence of shoulder pain and injury has been estimated at 2.5 injuries per 100 people playing per year, with 3.3% of all tennis injuries involving the shoulder (#7 of all musculoskeletal injuries in ten- nis). The prevalence of shoulder pain in competitive junior tennis players was found to be 24% in boys and 35% in girls over a 3-year study. Further, it has been found that 50% of expert players had a his- tory of shoulder pain and 74% of professional male tennis players and 60% of professional female ten- nis players had shoulder or elbow pain that affected their tennis at some point in the past. Swimming is another sport where shoulder pain is so prevalent that the term “swimmer’s shoulder” has become commonly accepted, though the exact pathology may be argued. It has been shown that the longer one swims, the higher the prevalence of shoulder pain and swimming intensity and distance are most associated with shoulder pain. Studies have shown that the prevalence of shoul- der pain increases with age. In a study of age group national level competitive swimmers, it was found that 11% of male and 9.4% of female competitive swimmers, aged 13–14 years had current shoulder pain that interfered with their training, while 21% of male and 25.5% of female competitive swim- mers aged 15–16 years had pain at the time of questioning that interfered with their swimming, and 17.7% of male and 35% of female swimmers with an average age of 19 years had shoulder pain limiting their swimming practice and competition.

Collegiate and master swimmers have been reported to have a 50% prevalence of shoul- der pain that lasted more than 3 weeks. Water polo is a sport that combines swimming and throwing, particularly throwing without the beneﬁ t of the full kinetic chain, which may account for a high prevalence of shoulder pain. Ice hockey and American football are the next two sports with very high incidences of shoul- der injuries, and these tend to be traumatic in origin — contact with the ground (ice, turf, or grass) or boards (hockey) or opponent. In foot- ball, shoulder injury was the fourth most common injury at the National Football League combines (the preparticipation examinations), where 50% of the players had a history of shoulder injury and there was an average of 1.3 shoulder injuries reported per player. Acromioclavicular joint injury was most prevalent (41%), with anterior instabil- ity (20%), rotator cuff injury (12%), clavicle frac- ture (4%), and posterior shoulder instability (4%), being the other common injuries reported.

Sports like body building and weightlifting may cause repetitive microtraumatic injury of the acromioclavicular joint, resulting in osteolysis of the distal clavicle (weight lifter’s shoulder) with prevalence estimated at 27%. Key risk factors: how to identify athletes at risk Scientiﬁ cally, little is known about the factors that lead to the majority of injuries in the shoulder. Consequ- ently, the description of key risk factors is based, to some extent, on theoretical assumptions. Intrinsic factors and extrinsic factors both con- tribute to overuse injuries, and to a limited extent, acute injuries. The intrinsic factors refer to growth and anatomic alignment, which are not very easy to control, but also include the muscle-tendon unit, balance, ﬂ exibility, ligamentous laxity, con- ditioning and anatomic variations (Table 9.2). The strength and ﬂ exibility of tissues and potential for adaptation to external loads are also dependent on age and probably gender. In terms of extrinsic fac- tors: training errors, including throwing mechan- ics, overuse, environment, and equipment play a signiﬁ cant role (Table 9.2). Age Overload problems are more common with increas- ing age, for example, the incidence of shoulder pain in baseball players is 0.7% in youth, 12.7% in college players, and 13.9% in professionals. On the other hand young baseball players are more likely Table 9.2 Internal and external factors for shoulder injury in different sports."}

The length of time while participating may also be a confounding fac- tor, as seen in weight lifting and swimming, where a cumulative effect over the years of overuse seems to be a reason for injury. Some age-related anatomical variations are also risk factors. For example, growth-plate-related problems in the proximal humerus of young baseball players, also known as “Little Leaguers Shoulder,” have been associated with the repeti- tive action of throwing. The forces caused by the repetitive throwing cause fragmentation and avul- sion of the growth plate, resulting in shoulder pain. Improper pitching mechanics have also been identiﬁ ed as a concomitant risk factor for devel- opment of this condition. Thus, both intrinsic factors, such as the growth plate being the weak- est link in the musculoskeletal system, combined with overuse and improper pitching mechanics, which are extrinsic forces, may coexist to produce injury. Gender There are no available data to identify gender as an independent risk factor for shoulder problems. Anatomical factors Overcrowding of the subacromial space, for exam- ple, if the acromion has a hooked shape or if the acromioclavicular joint is degenerated and hyper- trophic, protruding into the subacromial space, is a risk factor for outlet impingement (pinch- ing of the rotator cuff between the bones of the humerus and acromion). The precise contribu- tion of this factor in athletes is difﬁ cult to weigh, as many competitive conditions that can cause impingement may be present."}
{"id": "436", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "For instance, over- head athletes, such as those involved in baseball, swimming, water polo, and tennis, often suffer from not only tendinopathy or strains of the rota- tor cuff as a result of outlet impingement, but also because of cumulative tensile overload, instability, as well as with internal impingement (pinching of the rotator cuff between the greater tuberosity of the humerus and the postero-superior glenoid). Overhead athletes, including volleyball players, baseball players, and tennis players not only have a relatively high risk of suprascapular nerve injury, which may be related to posterior capsular tight- ness of the shoulder, but also may be affected by a narrow suprascapular notch or bony change of the transverse scapular ligament. Posterior capsular tightness of the shoulder has also been implicated in other problems such as internal impinge- ment and SLAP lesions (an injury to the superior labrum, anterior and posterior to the biceps ten- don anchor/attachment—essentially, an injury to the upper part of the ﬁ brocartilage rim that sur- rounds the socket of the shoulder), as well as sec- ondary impingement. Passive stability There is conﬂ icting evidence regarding gleno- humeral laxity as a risk factor for shoulder injury or pain. About 15% have an in born laxity (known as multidirectional), but anterior laxity is often seen in overhead athletes due to chronic overload. Excessive repetitive external rotation during the overhead motion places tremendous stress on the anterior capsular and ligamentous structures, causing microtrauma. Instability results when the dynamic stabilizers, such as the rotator cuff and periscapu- lar muscles, fatigue with repeated activity. Hence anterior glenohumeral translation occurs, with sub- sequent development of instability. Some sports, like swimming, select for individuals who have inherent ligamentous laxity about the shoulder, as proper swimming mechanics require extreme range of shoulder motion. With repetitive motion, such as prolonged swimming, the muscles that provide dynamic stability to the shoulder may fatigue, result- ing in microinstability."}
{"id": "437", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "The rotator cuff fatigues as a result of having to work harder to maintain gleno- humeral stability (due to the lax ligaments) and overuse from repeated activity (swim strokes). The rotator cuff fatigue leads to decreased ability to main- tain the humeral head within the glenoid. As a result of this subtle instability, secondary impingement of the rotator cuff anterosuperiorly against the cora- coacromial arch during forward ﬂ exion may occur, causing bursitis, tendinitis, or even undersurface tearing. Thus, in some sports, rotator cuff damage may be the result of overuse, pain from muscles fatiguing while trying to provide stability to a shoul- der with ligamentous laxity as well as due to excessive"}
{"id": "438", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "138 Chapter 9 translation of the humeral head resulting in impinge- ment. This latter cause of impingement occurs, as the rotator cuff becomes pinched between the humeral head and coracoacromial arch as a result of the loss of containment of the humeral head in the center of the glenoid due to loss of strength with the fatigued rotator cuff muscles. Glenohumeral laxity may well be a risk factor for these conditions, but the develop- ment of clinical symptoms is also caused by other factors, such as fatigue of the rotator cuff muscles. A condition known as “internal impingement” of the rotator cuff also occurs as a result of the altered kinematics in the injured shoulder of an overhead athlete. This occurs as the humeral head translates anteriorly with shoulder abduction and external rotation. There is internal impingement of the rotator cuff on the posterior superior region of the glenoid labrum. Concomitant posterior cap- sular contractures caused by repetitive stress may further exacerbate the impingement. This is also known as glenohumeral internal rotational deﬁ cit, or GIRD. Athletes typically present with decreased throwing effectiveness and pain, or a “dead arm.”Dynamic instability It is well described that athletes with shoulder pain have weakness of the scapula stabilizing mus- cles (serratus anterior and trapezius) and bad core stability."}
{"id": "439", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "It is generally assumed that scapulotho- racic instability is a risk factor for shoulder pain, including dynamic (secondary) impingement. On the other hand it has been shown that pain causes signiﬁ cant changes in muscular coordination by inhibiting muscular activity, so it is still an open question which risk factor came ﬁ rst. External factors: exposure to load The total exposure to load (years of weight lifting, hours of swimming) is a risk factor for degenera- tive and inﬂ ammatory conditions. For example, weight lifter’s shoulder is a problem of the distal clavicle, where there is osteolysis or bony resorp- tion. The pathophysiology is unknown, but felt to be due to microtraumatic overuse, resulting in a stress reaction of the acromioclavicular joint. Weight lifting, such as doing the bench press or the clean and jerk, increases the load on the acromioclavicular joint. Whereas rest helps resolve the symptoms, return to weight lifting will result in recurrence of symptoms. Also, a high number of pitches is associated with risk for shoulder symptoms. The relative risk in kids is 1.77 if more than 100 pitches are performed per game and 3.29 if more than 800 pitches are done within a season. The type of pitch is also a risk fac- tor with a relative risk of 1.52 for curve ball and 1.77 for slider."}
{"id": "440", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "The risk for shoulder problems is dependent on player position. In baseball, pitch- ers are at the highest risk, and in American football, quarterbacks have a relative risk of 1.52 and defen- sive backs of 1.2 for shoulder problems. Also, the injury pattern varies, as anterior shoulder instabil- ity is common in American football defensive play- ers and posterior instability and rotator cuff injury is seen in linemen. Mechanics of sports There are well-described mechanical factors that are of signiﬁ cant importance for the risk of trau- matic injury in baseball. Sliding with the head ﬁ rst as well as dive backs cause more shoulder injuries than other techniques. The power in the collision with the base is correlated to the severity of injury, and the use of breakaway bases instead of traditional solid bases reduces this power and the risk for injury. Identifying athletes at risk of injury Screening athletes for risk of shoulder problems can be done at the beginning of or at any time during the season. The reason to repeat the screening at intervals is that mismatch in muscle coordination may develop during training, even though it was not present at the start of the season. For instance, it has been shown there is a slowing in conduction veloc- ity of the suprascapular nerve in baseball pitchers as the season progresses, though the players remained asymptomatic. Further, it has been shown, that vol- leyball players with shoulder pain have a depressed and lateralized scapula and tightness of the posterior capsule and posterior muscles (Kugler et al.,"}

Athletes with an increased laxity in the glenohumeral joint (demonstrated by a sulcus sign) are theoretically at risk of injury and should also be tested for dys- functions, but there is no proof that laxity per se in a well-trained individual without dysfunctions or “black holes” is a risk factor. In players without symptoms or recent injury, the screening concentrates on identifying tradi- tional dysfunctions, as described by Caldwell et al. (2007). In one-arm dominant sports these dysfunc- tions usually appear in the dominant arm, and the two shoulders should always be compared. Even though there is only little scientiﬁ c evidence on whether dysfunctions cause shoulder symptoms and overload injuries or that identiﬁ cation and correction of dysfunctions can prevent overload problems, this strategy is generally accepted. The contents of a screening examination are listed in Table 9.3. A description of the various tests can be found in other textbooks. Tests for scapular sta- bility are shown in Box 9.1. Take-home message Though, as of yet there is not much scientiﬁ c proof that injuries can be predicted based on phys- ical examination or prevented by correcting prob- lems identiﬁ ed on examination, there is hope that correcting some of the above physical examination ﬁ ndings may prevent overuse injuries and may enable the shoulder to sustain traumatic incidents."}

Test Comments Inspection of stature An increased thoracic kyphosis leads to a downward-anterior position of the acromion, which reduces the subacromial space and increases risk of impingement. Cervical lordosis increases posterior compression and the risk of compression to the C5 and C6 nerve roots, and may lead to referred pain in the shoulder region (Figure 9.6). Inspection of resting position of the arm Protrusion of more than 1/3rd of the humeral head anterior to the acromion stresses the anterior shoulder capsule and may be caused by a tight posterior capsule or contract outward rotating muscles. Inward rotation of the arm is caused by dominant pectoralis major and minor and latissimus dorsi muscles and reduces the subacromial space, increasing risk of impingement. Inspection of the resting scapula Winging as well as when the superior, medial corner is more lateral than the inferior, reduces the subacromial space, increasing risk of impingement. Inspection of the moving scapula If the inferior corner of scapula does not reach the mid-axillary line during full ﬂ exion of the arm, the acromion is not elevated sufﬁ ciently during motion, increasing the risk of impingement. If winging occurs early during arm push-ups there is mismatch in muscular coordination."}

Injury mechanisms Because the shoulder has more motion than any other joint in the body, it has little bony con- straint to allow for this motion, and the stability and motion is primarily controlled by muscles and soft tissues. Traumatic and overuse injuries to the shoulder can therefore damage a large number of different structures in and around the shoulder. Traumatic injuries can be divided into direct and indirect injuries, depending on according to the position of the arm and the applied force. Direct traumatic injuries Direct injuries are falls or blows directly on the shoulder, most often on the lateral side or the front.

More severe trauma may result in a clavicle fracture, a contu- sion or dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint (Figure 9.1) or fractures of the upper humerus or (rarely) the glenoid. Falls are common in cycling (when going over the handle bars) and skiing. Blows are common in American football (i.e., when a player gets low and uses the shoulder to take an opponent or gets tackled and lands on their shoulder) and ice hockey (when the player hits an opponent or the boards with the shoulder). Compression hap- pens in ice hockey, when the player skates along- side the boards and is hit by an opponent. Because of the high velocity, the player is subjected to an enormous compression force between the oppo- nent and the fence. A similar compression occurs in American football when being tackled. The resulting injury depends on the exact direc- tion of the force and the anatomical structure that is subject to the trauma. If the acromion is hit in a skeletally mature athlete, an injury to the acromi- oclavicular joint is most likely, if the clavicle is hit a clavicular fracture is likely, and if the upper arm is hit, a proximal humerus fracture is likely to occur. In the older athlete, fracture of the clavi- cle or the humerus is more likely to happen than dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint, as the bone becomes weaker with age."}

The brachial nerve plexus can be stretched by a direct blow to the superior side of the shoulder, anterior or posterior sudden, force- ful pushes to the shoulder or pulls of the arm, and may lead to a “burner,” that is, diffuse pain of the shoulder and arm, caused by injury of one or several nerves, though usually the upper trunk (Figure 9.2). This typically happens if a player uses the shoulder to butt other players. Indirect traumatic injuries Indirect injuries are caused by transmission of force through the arm. Fall on an outstretched, ﬂ exed arm may result in a Bankart-like lesion of the pos- terior capsule, but most often in acromioclavicular joint damage, as the posterior shoulder capsule is very tight and transmits the force to the scapula. The injury after fall on an outstretched, abducted arm depends on the amount of abduction: below horizontal a SLAP lesion can occur, above hori- zontal a Bankart lesion/dislocation is more likely (where the labral or cartilage rim injury is in the anterior lower quarter of the socket). Fall on extended arm results in a SLAP or Bankart lesion or an acromioclavicular-joint lesion. A force that involves rotation of the arm, that is, blocking a throw or falling on a slightly abducted/outwardly rotated arm with ﬂ exed elbow applies tremendous force on the rotator cuff and the accelerating mus- cles.

If the arm is positioned behind the shoulder joint, blocking can result in an anterior translation of the humeral head and an injury of the anterior structures of the glenohumeral joint, typically a Bankart lesion (Figure 9.3). This injury mechanism is quite com- mon in body building/strength training as a result of an extreme extension of the arms during bench press or downward pulls. If the arms are extended to more than 0º during these exercises (i.e., if the arms are moved behind the shoulder joint), there is extreme tension on the anterior structures of the glenohumeral joint, in particular the labrum and glenohumeral ligaments. If the internal rotators of the arm fail to resist the load, this may cause a Bankart or SLAP lesion or stretching of the anterior capsule. Incidents that make a sudden, powerful inward rotation of the arm combined with ﬂ exion of the elbow necessary, if to avoid an object from hitting the head, can rupture the lateral portion of the coracohumeral ligament (which covers the biceps groove between the lesser and greater tuber- cles and holds the biceps tendon in the groove) as well as the upper part of the subscapularis tendon insertion on the lesser tubercle. This results in a biceps tendon dislocation or subluxation. It is the least strong tissue that is damaged dur- ing trauma. In children, the epiphyseal growth Figure 9.2.

Also epiphysiolysis of the greater tubercle or the neck of the humerus can happen. In young and middle- aged athletes, the soft tissue is usually the weakest. In athletes above 60 years the natural decrease in bone mineral content makes fractures and avul- sions more likely to happen, but tendons—in par- ticular the rotator cuff tendons and the long head of biceps—also weaken with age, and ruptures can happen after minor trauma or almost spontane- ously, such as during tennis or badminton. Overuse injuries Overuse injuries can be caused by a repeated, pow- erful force to a structure through sports (extrin- sic factors). In most cases this is the result of an increase in training intensity, introduction of a new technique, or new equipment, etc. The load on soft tissue structures exceeds capacity of the tis- sue, leading to inﬂ ammation and pain. This acute condition is easily reversible, if the load is adjusted to the capacity. Weight lifting applies enormous forces through the acromioclavicular joint, and swimming applies a huge number of rotations in the acromioclavicu- lar joint, both mechanisms resulting in inﬂ am- mation and gradually degenerative disease in the acromioclavicular joint.

Laxity of the glenohumeral joint (which is seen in 10% of the population, represented as a large sulcus sign) is compensated for by activation of the rotator cuff muscles, when the athlete is using the arm in activities, which are dependent on stability. If these muscles are not strong enough for this work, then either the muscles are overused (resulting in tendo- nitis and tendinosis of the tendons and muscle pain) or the humeral head is not positioned correctly dur- ing the activity (resulting in painful stretching of the glenohumeral ligaments and the capsule). The thoracoscapular junction is the base of the arm. Insufﬁ cient stability of this is caused by relative weak- ness of the rhomboids and serratus anterior (pressing the scapula against the thoracic wall), resulting in compensating, painful dysfunctions in other mus- cles. Dyscoordination of the scapula in throwing or overhead activities is most often caused by weakness or fatigue of serratus anterior and trapezius—both muscles are responsible for the elevation of acromion during overhead activities, and if this motion is delayed or insufﬁ cient, the acromion presses against the humeral head, resulting in impingement of the supraspinatus tendon and inﬂ ammation of the subacromial bursa (Figure 9.5). Overuse injuries caused by these preexisting conditions are seen in throwing sports (repeated powerful activities to the extreme ranges of motion), swimming (repeated activities), weight lifting (powerful activities), and body building (powerful activities and a risk that only the accelerating muscles are body built). Pain Pain in the shoulder has great inﬂ uence on the function of muscles. The activity of the agonist for the painful motion is reduced under dynamic conditions, probably as a reﬂ ex-like reaction, and in some cases the antagonist activity is increased. Also, motion patterns are changed to avoid pain."}

In this way, a self-perpetuating process may be initiated. Protective equipment The use of protective equipment can in some cases cause injury.

Protective devices may also give the athlete a sense of security, prompting them to play more aggres- sively, leading to injury to themselves and others. (a) (b) (c) Figure 9.5.

Identifying risks in the training and competition program In sports with a season, the athletes may be less ﬁ t at the beginning of the season. The smaller muscles (including the rotator cuff muscles) are at higher risk than the larger muscles to lose strength. A mis- match between the shoulder muscles can often be identiﬁ ed as described earlier, but smaller changes, that become important with 50 or 100 repeti- tions, may be difﬁ cult to demonstrate clinically. For example, the rotator cuff muscles may fatigue after 25 hard throws, whereas the larger muscles can easily do 100. This mismatch may also occur later during the season, because the larger mus- cles adapt more easily to increasing load. Thoracic kyphosis may increase as the shoulders rotate ante- rior and inward due to strong latissimus and pec- toralis major muscles, and the scapula is rotated downward due to the pectoralis minor muscle, both decreasing the subacromial space and increas- ing the risk of impingement. It is therefore essential that the training pro- gram contains a balanced amount of exercises all through the season. It is not uncommon to con- centrate on maximum efforts in function (strength) and coordination, and only do very demanding training."}
{"id": "456", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "This will leave the weaker and smaller muscles behind. Warm-up, which should start every training session, activates all structures (mus- cles, tendons, ligaments, joints) as well as the psy- che (concentration and awareness, which should not be neglected). The structures become ready for maximum work, and the maximum effort training is suitable after warm-up. All athletes know that after having performed maximum training for a while, either some structures fatigue or the athlete loses concentration and awareness. Instead of end- ing training abruptly from the heavy exercises, lighter and easier activities, that all structures and the psyche can participate in, should complete the training session. In this way, no structure is lost due to fatigue. Also, if just one structure is not par- ticipating, the heavy exercises should not be con- tinued. It is common to continue until complete fatigue, but this leads to a high risk of losing the weaker structures. That mismatch between muscle groups is com- mon was shown in a project, where 2000 m swim- mers were tested for scapular stability by wall-push ups at several swimming distances. After 500 m 36% had winging of scapula, after 1000 m this was seen in 79%, and after 1500 m in 93%."}

In tennis, the speed and force of the ball changes from slow and weak on the relatively soft outdoor ground, particularly clay surface, to fast and forceful on hard indoor courts. This increases the need for strength, fast reaction, precision, and coordination markedly, and if the player has not prepared for this through training, overuse injury and traumatic lesions to muscles, tendons, etc. may occur. This is naturally also the case if equip- ment is changed, for instance, if tension of the strings in the racket is changed or another type of tennis ball is used.

Preventing traumatic injury Shoulder pads can theoretically spread the force from an impact over a large area of the body and absorb energy (just like a bicycle helmet). There are no studies that prove that this can actually reduce the number or severity of shoulder injuries caused by direct blows, and hard shoulder pads have the drawback that they can hurt other players, partic- ularly if they are used to butt others. In American football, shoulder pads protect the shoulder, dissi- pating the forces that would otherwise be placed on the acromioclavicular joint or the sternoclavicular joint during an axial load. Proper falling mechanics can also be taught to potentially lessen the direct impact placed across the shoulder joint by learning to roll when landing from a fall, rather than land- ing directly on the shoulder. Cervical orthoses are used to prevent injury to the neck and the brachial plexus (“burners”). In a laboratory setting they can be shown to reduce hyperextension of the neck, but lateral bending—which is assumed to be a major cause of nerve injury—is not consistently reduced, and the clinical relevance remains to be proven. Head-ﬁ rst and diveback sliding techniques in baseball and softball can result in upper extremity injuries. But changing of techniques (e.g., banning sliding or forbidding head-ﬁ rst/diveback sliding) is impractical and unsatisfactory to players, and instructional courses regarding injury prevention have proved ineffective (players did not attend) (Janda, 2003)."}

Injury prevention strategies like protective equipment, rule changes, preseason and season prevention interventions, safety measures, better coaching, education and a social awareness have been recommended to reduce sports injuries in children (Demorest & Landry, 2003), but none of these strategies have been shown to be effective. It has been suggested that extrinsic factors may be positively modiﬁ ed to reduce collision injuries and falls by using deformable walls and padded back stops as well as maintaining ﬁ elds appropri- ately, however this has not been supported in the literature. Another statement modifying intrinsic risk factors, such as better coaching techniques as well as stretching and conditioning programs have been purported to beneﬁ t players in the preven- tion of their injuries, though again, this has not been objectively supported in the literature.

Theoretically it would to prevent some traumatic injuries if the athlete only did sports within the limits of his/her personal qualiﬁ cations or physical condition, and avoided risky situations (like skiing off piste, skiing in bad weather conditions, hud- dling in bicycling, etc.). Also the rules can be used to prevent injury, for example, by forbidding body checking, tearing, or blocking of the arm. Preventing overuse injuries The thrower’s paradox is that functional stability is a key basis for performance, while at the same time performance is dependent of full mobility. Therefore stability cannot be achieved by tight- ness, but relies mainly on muscular coordination and strength. To some extent the training programs are the same for preventing overuse shoulder injuries and for treating symptomatic shoulders. The strategy is also the same: training should always address all structures and all functions (strength, stability, ﬂ exibility, coordination, core stability)."}

The standard training program will typi- cally contain the elements listed in Table 9.5. Traditional body building of muscles that are used to create power is often not necessary, as strength- ening of these muscles often follows from the spe- ciﬁ c sports activities. The strength of the rotator cuff muscles is trained either with a rubber band (which is very handy, as it can be brought everywhere) or weights. The athlete should mix power training (with sufﬁ cient weight, that only 6–10 repetitions leads to fatigue) and endurance training (less load, where the athlete can perform 20–25 repetitions). The speciﬁ c exer- cises are shown in Box 9.2. Serratus anterior and trapezius are the muscles that lift scapula during abduction, ﬂ exion, and throwing, and they are often overruled by, for example, the levator scapula muscle. The trapezius should be trained in order to maintain scapular stability and mid-thoracic stability of the spine. The serratus anterior muscle can be trained with side bridge and wall-press exercises as well."}

Just like it is much more difﬁ cult to manipulate a heavy load if you are standing in loose sand, it is difﬁ - cult to make a powerful throw, if the body is not a strong, supportive basis. Therefore core stability training is also a part of basic shoulder training. Core stability training is part of many of the exercises previously described and trains the trans- versus abdominis muscles, the other abdominal muscles (including diaphragm), the multiﬁ des, and a number of other spinal muscles. Core stability is obtained by pulling the umbilicus toward the third lumbar segment, ﬂ attening the abdominal wall. Strong muscles tend to shorten and change the resting position of the shoulder. This is also the case with the posterior capsule. To avoid this, stretching should end all training sessions."}

Proper throwing mechanics and limiting the number of pitches and innings thrown are crucial for prevention of injury, particularly in the grow- ing athlete. Control, not speed, should be empha- sized in training regimens. In addition, educating coaches and players about appropriate stretching, strengthening, conditioning, and proper throwing mechanics is vital. The literature on this topic has fortunately resulted in published guidelines that limit the number of innings that young pitch- ers are allowed to pitch per week. The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons recommends limiting pitches to about 4 to 10 innings per week, 80–100 pitches maximum per game, and 30–40 pitches per practice session (Tables 10.7 and 10.8). It has been suggested that certain pitching, bat- ting, and ﬁ elding techniques might be related to injury, in particular the underarm technique dur- ing softball pitching (Flyger et al.,"}

Shoulder problems caused by overloading dur- ing the golf swing can theoretically be prevented by a warm-up program. Overuse injuries are more common in golfers that do not perform a warm-up program, but the effect of the program has never been studied in a regular trial (Fradkin et al.,2005). Cushion grip bands have been proven to reduce impact shock and vibration transfer in tennis rac- quets. This could reduce the load on elbow and shoulder and positively inﬂ uence the risk for over- load injuries, but the effect remains to be proven. Strength training In athletes, strength training of the shoulders should not be performed without the basic shoul- der training program, which is described earlier. Without the basic program, there is an obvious risk of creating mismatch between muscles. Strength training can be performed after standard principles as high load (maximum 10 repetitions possible) to increase power or as low load (many repetitions) to increase endurance and ﬂ exibility."}

Bench press is typically an exercise in which the arms are quite often moved behind the shoulders, creating anterior pain in the shoulder. Getting back after shoulder injury The aim of physical therapy after shoulder injury is to relieve pain, expedite the return of the athlete to play, and most importantly, to prevent new inju- ries before they develop. Stretching is important to establish and maintain full range of motion, especially in patients with tight posterior capsules with limited internal rotation. “Sleeper stretches” are stretching maneuvers which are effective in stretching the posterior capsule, and prevent inter- nal impingement associated with GIRD. They are performed with the athlete lying on the affected side, with the shoulder abducted 90º. Gentle con- stant pressure is applied by the opposite arm, push- ing the affected shoulder into internal rotation. During the acute phase of tendinitis, exercises should be performed below shoulder level to avoid rotator cuff outlet impingement, with gradual pro- gression as symptoms decrease. In the majority of cases, non-surgical treatment allows gradual return to sport. A strengthening program is instituted to increase strength in the rotator cuff as well as in the scapu- lar stabilizers to provide dynamic glenohumeral stability. Both concentric and eccentric exercises are included."}

Throwing athletes are allowed to return gradually to throwing once stability, strength, and endurance have improved (usually within 3 months). Most will be able to return to their prior level of activity in 6 months. Swimmers tend to develop tightness in the pec- toralis minor, which leads to a protracted shoulder posture. This decreases the subacromial space and contributes to outlet impingement syndrome. This may be prevented by stretching the pectoralis minor. Wrestlers tend to strengthen their anterior shoulder and chest muscles disproportionately in relation to their periscapular and back muscles, resulting in a protracted shoulder posture. This also decreases the subacromial space and contrib- utes to outlet impingement syndrome. This may be prevented by strengthening the rhomboids and scapular retractor muscles.

The risk for overload injuries, which are very common in shoulders, can theoretically be reduced if all athletes are screened regularly for weakness in glenohumeral and scapulothoracic stability and for lack of balance between muscles (identifying dominance of muscles, most often inward rotators of the arm and downward rotators of the acromion). It is recommended that weak- nesses and dysfunctions are treated by exercise programs, but the effect of this on injury preven- tion remains to be proven. Learning the proper techniques in the individual sports is thought to be important for prevention of overload.

The joint has two degrees of freedom, ﬂ exion/ extension and pronation/supination, which play important roles in most sports by transferring forces between the body core and shoulder to the hand. In addition, the elbow allows the athlete to speciﬁ cally, repetitively, and with a great deal of ﬁ nesse position their hand in space. Excessive forces leading to injury can come from acute loads as seen in direct trauma and falls or chronic loads as seen in overuse and repetitive microtrauma. High demand versus low demand sports Sports with relatively low upper extremity demand would be expected to have low risk of elbow inju- ries; and, indeed, this is true. Soccer (other than the goalie), track and cross-country, as well as the purely jumping sports such as long jump, high jump, and triple jump have a low risk of elbow injuries. Other sports such as Nordic or Alpine ski- ing, equestrian, cycling, speed skating, and ﬁ gure skating have relatively low risk until high energy falls are considered. When all sports are consid- ered in adolescent athletes, the elbow accounts for only 2–5% of all injuries (Table 10.1). In sports that have a higher throwing demand such as base- ball the incidence jumps up to 17–70% depend- ing on the position, age, and deﬁ nition of injury (Table 10.1). High energy injuries The transfer of large, acute loads risks catastrophic failure of ligaments, tendons, or bone."}

Acute traumatic injuries are most common in contact and collision sports (American football, rugby, martial arts, etc.),sports that place an athlete at elevated heights (high jump, ski jumping, gymnastics, etc.),and high energy sports in which the athlete is at a great rate of speed (alpine skiing, speed skating, cycling, etc.). Eight percent of judo injuries, 4% in wrestling, and 3–4% in ice hockey involve the elbow (Table 10.1). In addition, sports such as weight-lifting, boxing, shot put, and gymnastics place acute and heavy loads across the elbow joint during the course of participation. In some cases, the force across the elbow can far exceed the body weight of the gym- nast, the weight being lifted, or the weight being thrown. If the loads aren’t balanced appropriately across the joint, catastrophic failure occurs.

Chronic overuse can weaken the native structural elements to the extent that normally submaximal loads exceed the ultimate strength of the structure and lead to catastrophic failure. Repetitive overuse injuries are more common in upper extremity demanding sports that use a rac- quet or stick (tennis, racquetball, golf, lacrosse, etc.)or throw an object (javelin, baseball, soft- ball, etc.). Nearly 9% of baseball injuries, 7% of javelin injuries, 5% of softball injuries, and 3% of tennis injuries involve the elbow (Table 10.1). It is in these sports that the elbow’s functional demand of repetitively placing the hand in space is particularly important. With subtle variations of hand positions the ball or object to be deliv- ered may end up in a completely unintended location. Failure or dysfunction at the elbow will lead to poor performance and potentially fur- ther injury at the elbow or adjacent structures. Chronic overuse injuries about the elbow include: tendinopathy of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (tennis elbow), tendinopathy of the ﬂ exor mus- cle insertions (golfer’s elbow), bicipital tendin- opathy, cubital tunnel syndrome (ulnar neuritis), ulnar nerve instability, pronator teres syndrome (median nerve entrapment), stress fractures, oste- ochondritis dissecans, or valgus extension over- load syndrome with associated spurring or loose body formation from the olecranon or capitellum.

Key risk factors: how to identify athletes at risk When making an effort to prevent injuries, it is important to recognize not only the overall risk in a speciﬁ c sport but also any key risk factors relative to the athlete. Is it possible to identify athletes at risk to be able to target prevention programs? These factors may be categorized as either inter- nal or external inﬂ uences. Internal factors include the unique anatomy of the elbow, age of the par- ticipant relative to physeal closure, articular align- ment, physical strength, and coordination of the kinetic chain (Table 10.2). Gender may play a small role; however, it is more likely that how intensely and how often the athlete uses his elbow is the greatest risk factor. External factors include such things as the level of play, number or repetitions or throws, amount of rest between competitions, risk of contact and collision in a speciﬁ c sport, equipment, environment, and the technical style (form, overhead motion versus side-arm motion, or coordinated progression of the kinetic chain). Young athletes and growing bones The skeletally immature elbow has numerous ossi- ﬁ cation centers and growth plates which, regard- ing injuries, are the “weak link.”The ossiﬁ cation center of the capitellum is at risk of vascular injury secondary to repeated compression associated with weight-lifting and boxing, the weight-bear- ing demands of gymnastics, or the valgus stresses associated with throwing (Figure 10.1).

This is particularly true in the throwing athlete where poor coordination of the scapular stabilization muscles (scapular dyskinesia) has been directly correlated with an increased risk of elbow injuries. Similarly poor coordination of core muscles including the lumbar spine, abdomi- nals, and gluteal muscles has been associated with poor transfer of kinetic forces and overuse of the structures about the elbow. The throwing ath- lete with poor core mechanics tends to alter their throwing style in an effort to maintain the same throwing velocity. This is often at the expense of ideal shoulder and elbow positioning which places the elbow at an increased risk of injury. A his- tory of shoulder injuries, indeed a history of any injury along the kinetic chain, has been directly correlated to an increased risk of elbow injuries (Table 10.2). Identifying external risk factors In addition, a number of external factors play key roles in the incidence of elbow injuries. These external inﬂ uences include how frequently the athlete is asked to use or load the elbow, how much rest is allowed between events to allow the elbow to recover, certain styles of performance, as well as the effect of equipment modiﬁ cations including grips, braces, string tension of racquets, and weight or size of a projectile being thrown (Table 10.2). Baseball, a classic throwing sport, and tennis, a classic racquet sport, have been the two sports subjected to the greatest scientiﬁ c scrutiny. In baseball, a ball is delivered in an overhand throwing style at speeds approaching 160 km/h over 100 times in a game."}

Excellent studies are available in the skele- tally immature thrower that show that elbow inju- ries including medial epicondyle epiphysitis and osteochondritis dissecans are directly associated with the total number of pitches delivered per game, per week, and per season (Table 10.2). The same studies reveal that limiting young throw- ers to a certain number of pitches can reduce the overall incidence of injury. In addition, when the young athlete is allowed a period of rest between outings, his elbow is allowed to recover and the incidence of injury is further reduced. Throwing mechanics including speciﬁ c pitch type have also been carefully studied in baseball regarding their relationship to injury risk (Figure 10.4).

The fast ball has been shown to create the greatest forces across the elbow joint followed by the slider, cur- veball, and change-up. A curveball is thrown by altering the pitcher’s grip on the seams and by repositioning their wrist during the delivery. In a well-thrown curveball, very little mechanical change is perceived across the elbow. However, in a young thrower learning to throw the pitch, they tend to drop their hand delivering the ball in a more side-arm motion, they tend to lead with their elbow throwing the ball more like a dart. Alternatively, the young thrower may try to explosively supinate their forearm with delivery. These mechanical alterations increase the load across the elbow and increase the risk of injury. For this reason, throwing the curveball is discour- aged in the skeletally immature thrower until nearing skeletal maturity when they can perform it with proper technique and do not risk their open growth plates. In elite level pitchers the side-arm motion has been studied and shown to have very little cor- relation with elbow injuries.

The difference occurs in the lat- eral tilt of the torso in the side-arm thrower. While this may increase the risk of low back problems, there does not appear to be increased loads across the elbow (Table 10.2, Figure 10.4). Windmill style of pitching seen in softball has very little risk of elbow injury. Risk factors in racquet sports During service, tennis and many racquet sports mimic the overhead throwing motion. Therefore, athletes in racquet sports can be equally suscep- tible to repetitive overuse injuries and failures in the kinetic chain as are athletes participating in predominantly throwing sports. The racquet pro- vides an increased extension moment that can further load all units of the kinetic chain includ- ing the elbow (Figure 10.5). Longer racquets increase the load. Tighter strung racquets or more rigid racquets absorb less shock and transfer the loads directly up the kinetic chain with the ﬁ rst stop being the wrist and elbow. It is, therefore, not surprising that longer, rigid racquets with tight strings increase the risk of tennis elbow in the ath- letes that use them (Table 10.2)."}

A small grip forces the athlete to shorten their ﬂ exors and places the ﬁ nger and wrist exten- sors at greater length. This increases the forces at the elbow during a backhand or wrist extension maneuver. Larger grips have been used to reduce this risk or treat the athlete with an early onset of lateral tendinopathy. Recent studies have sug- gested that grip size changes of less than ¼ of an inch have no effect on forearm muscle ﬁ ring pat- terns.

Likewise ball players on grass versus synthetic turf have not been correlated with an increased risk of elbow injuries although falls on synthetic turf lead to more skin abrasions than on natural grass. Sports with compressive loads across the elbow Repetitive compressive loads across the elbow such as seen in weight-lifting, boxing, and gymnastics are another key risk factor for the development of chronic elbow problems. In the skeletally imma- ture elbow these repetitive compressive loads have been directly associated with osteochondritis dissecans of the capitellum, olecranon impinge- ment, and medial epicondylitis (Figure 10.1). The intensity and frequency of loading may place the skeletally mature elbow at risk of degenerative changes of the articular surface or the creation of osteochondral loose bodies. Many master athletes who have participated for many years develop sec- ondary changes and degenerative changes in the lateral and posterior compartments of the elbow. Identifying the athlete at risk of elbow injuries from compressive loading begins with early recog- nition of complaints and an immediate period of rest. Loading and weight-bearing are inherent to the sports of boxing, gymnastics, and weight-lift- ing and cannot be eliminated completely."}

He/she is the one who has the most repetitions, creates the highest forces across the elbow, and is likely to be the most intense in training taking minimal peri- ods of rest. Be attentive to faulty mechanics in not only sport-speciﬁ c techniques but also of core strength and stability. Young athletes should be progressive in their skill-building. If performance begins to decline, it may be the ﬁ rst sign in the development of an overuse injury which should indicate initiating a period of rest and recovery. Injury mechanisms As noted earlier, elbow injuries can be classiﬁ ed as acute or chronic. Acute injuries are more common in contact and collision sports (American football, rugby, ice hockey, and martial arts) or in any sport at risk of high energy falls (skiing, snowboard- ing, gymnastics, and equestrian). There may be direct (impact directly onto the elbow) or indirect (fall on an outstretched hand or torques across Figure 10.5.

Educating athletes on how to fall and the use of protective equipment like elbow pads in certain sports may provide some prevention effect. FOOSH: fall on an outstretched hand The classic description is a fall on an outstretched hand (FOOSH) (Figure 10.6). When the forces are excessive, the elbow is hyper-extended leading ﬁ rst to rupture of the collateral ligaments (medial before lateral) and anterior capsule. If the force continues, the elbow will dislocate. In some cases, bony avulsions of ligaments or apophyses will occur instead of pure ligamentous injury. In severe injuries, neurovascular structures will be injured with severe displacement. Urgent reduction is essential. In athletes who fall on extended elbow with the hand in full supination, there is a risk of an isolated injury to the posterolateral corner of the elbow."}
{"id": "499", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "In this case, the lateral collateral liga- ment and annular ligament at the radial neck are injured and lead to posterior subluxation or insta- bility of the radial head. In children who fall on an outstretched arm, the weak link is the growth plate. Injuries that appear as elbow dislocations frequently have associated epiphyseal or apophyseal injuries. It is strongly rec- ommended to obtain bilateral radiographs in the skeletally immature for comparison. The appear- ance and position of each growth center should be symmetric to the opposite side. Anatomic reduc- tion of any displaced intra-articular fracture or a supracondylar fracture is essential to avoid long- term complications of malalignment or arthritis. Admittedly, this does not prevent the initial injury but early recognition and treatment can prevent later problems and disability. Direct impact injuries Direct impact onto the elbow by an object, impact onto the court surface, or collision into a barrier wall can lead to elbow injuries including bone bruises, ligament strains, muscle contusions, and skin abrasions. The ulnar nerve is relatively sub- cutaneous on the posterior medial aspect of the elbow. Direct impact can lead to a temporary neu- ropraxia or chronic ulnar neuritis."}

Fortunately, it is this overuse that gives us our best target to prevent elbow injuries. Repetitive varus loading as seen in the lead hand in golf and in the backhand dur- ing tennis leads to strain of the lateral collateral ligament as well as the wrist extensor muscles. Repetitive valgus stress seen in throwing and rac- quet sports leads to an increased strain of the medial collateral ligament, overuse of the ﬂ exor muscles, and compression of the radiocapitel- lar articulation (Figure 10.7). Repetitive extension loads seen in the follow-through phase of throwers or when weightlifters lock their elbow in full exten- sion can lead to impingement of the olecranon posteriorly, traction of the triceps muscle, and ten- sion the capsule anteriorly. Repetitive compressive loads seen in gymnastics and weight-lifting serve to load the articular surface directly. In each case the ligaments and bones feel the direct force of the loading, however, the muscles that cross the joint serve as dynamic stabilizers that are at risk of injury with repetitive overuse. To resist varus loading, the lateral muscles ﬁ re to assist in stabilizing the joint. Unfortunately due to the relative proximity to the joint surface they are at a mechanical disadvantage to overcome these repetitive loads. The classic example of this occurs with the tennis backhand."}

Indeed a similar phe- nomenon is seen on the medial aspect of the elbow in golfers (Figure 10.8).

The more likely mechanism of injury is that the injury occurs when the golfer hits down on the ball too forcefully and takes too large a divot. This would lead to acute loads of the ﬂ exor muscles of the trailing hand at impact. Indeed this occurs much more frequently in amateur golfers than pro- fessional golfers who have honed their swing. Injuries in throwing sports Perhaps the greatest focus of study on injury mecha- nisms about the elbow has occurred in throwing sports. As the ball or javelin is delivered, the elbow goes through a sequence of muscle activity, loading, and mobility that stresses different aspects of the joint through the range of motion. In the early cock- ing phase, the elbow is usually in slight to moderate ﬂ exion and is relatively at a low stressful position as the arm is being positioned to begin transferring loads up the kinetic chain with the goal of ulti- mately delivering the projectile from the hand. In late cocking and early acceleration the medial col- lateral ligament and radiocapitellar articulation are loaded with valgus stress that continues to increase as acceleration occurs (Figure 10.9). Throwers usu- ally pronate their arms to some degree in this phase to reduce the intense valgus loads. As the projectile is delivered, the elbow comes into full extension and the perarticular muscles (especially elbow ﬂ exors) ﬁ re to resist the large extension moment."}
{"id": "504", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "The extension moment is also resisted by the bony architecture posteriorly as the olecronon falls into the olecranon fossa posteriorly. This repetitive valgus loading and extension moment can lead to speciﬁ c group over- use injuries and, therefore, this pathomechanic has been coined valgus-extension overload. The valgus component can lead to ulnar collateral instability, avulsions of medial epicondyle, medial epicondyle epiphysitis, secondary ulnar nerve neuropraxia. In addition the valgus loads apply compressive loads to the radio-capitellar articulation which can lead to radial head fractures, radial head hypertrophy, oste- ochondral lesions, degeneration of the capitellum, or osteochondritis dissecans. The extension compo- nent leads to posterior olecranon impingement. In association with valgus instability, this extension component leads to speciﬁ c spurs on the posterior medial aspect of the olecranon that engage during the throwing motion and can lead to pain or create loose bodies. This valgus extension overload mecha- nism is exactly the same during the overhead service in racquet sports. Another common mechanism of chronic elbow injury is the repetitive compressive loading as seen in sports such as gymnastics, boxing, and weight- lifting. The anatomic structures at risk are the same as those with throwing athletes; however, the compressive loads are greater. This places the artic- ular surface at a relatively greater risk of overuse failure compared to throwers with similar number of loads events."}

Identifying risks in the training and competition program As we have seen, multiple factors contribute to the incidence and prevalence of elbow injuries in ath- letes. The relationship of training, practice, or com- petition to injury incidence has been well studied regarding injuries in general but less well evaluated for elbows in particular. The key issues for elbow injuries are the number of repetitions or exposure to traumatic events in training versus competitive situations. In contact and collisions sports, the ath- lete is at greater risk of acute trauma during compe- tition where their opponent is trying to overwhelm their strength or position. In practice situations, players more frequently are less “all out” as com- pared to a competition. An exception to this rule is spring football in American rules football in which teams play competitively amongst their own team vying for positions on the next years teams. Injury rates are greater at this time than the regular sea- son. For gymnasts, they are at risk of traumatic injuries at any time they are at competition height on apparatus regardless practice or competition. Training versus competition seems to have a major effect on overuse injuries."}
{"id": "507", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Overuse injuries are always more common when an athlete begins to train intensely after an extended period of rest or when they are asked to signiﬁ cantly ramp up their training immediately prior to a major com- petition or event. This is true for the elbow as it is for most body parts. Prevention usually targets a gradual increase in stresses and intensity rather than these acute changes in training patterns to avoid the risk of overuse injuries. Skeletal maturity and training For the skeletally immature thrower, the injury risk appears to be less related to training or competition compared to the actual number of full speed tosses they perform in a given time period. Too many throws on too little rest is directly related to an increased injury incidence. Likewise for the mature thrower, overuse elbow injuries have been related to the total number of pitches and amount of rest between outings. For the mature athlete, core strength and a coor- dinated kinetic chain have a central role in injury prevention. Coaches and trainers should carefully evaluate the throwing mechanic of their athletes early in the training season to assure that there are no deﬁ cits in the kinetic chain that might pre- dict future injury. During competition, the kinetic chain may also play a key role in the risk of elbow injury. As the athlete fatigues later in competition, he is more likely to overuse single components of the kinetic chain leading to a failure of the coordi- nated sequence of movement and placing any link at risk of injury."}
{"id": "508", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Based on this knowledge, coaches should be astute observers of athletic performance and biomechanics during competition. The ath- lete should be removed from play when proximal links of the kinetic chain reveal weakness, poor coordination, or failure because the elbow may be the next link to fail. Preventive measures The foundation of a targeted prevention plan to reduce elbow injuries should be based on available science and our historical knowledge regarding incidence and mechanism. The ideal of eliminat- ing all injuries is not reasonable as athletic par- ticipation carries some inherent risk. Nonetheless, minimizing risk and preventing the progression of a minor deﬁ cit or problem to a more signiﬁ cant injury is clearly our best option. A valid preven- tion plan should target the injury patterns that are most common, most potentially disabling, and in which intervention can be the most effective. Targeting acute injuries For acute and traumatic injuries of the elbow, pre- vention should target minimizing risk exposures and energy level when such an exposure would not affect the routine and legal performance of"}

This may be accomplished via rigid rule enforcement, more severe penalties for violations, or rules changes. An example that has been effec- tive was limiting the height of cheerleader tow- ers which, in turn, reduced the potential energy and risk of injury from falls (Boden et al.,2003). Examples that could be effective include rules changes, the imposition of stiffer penalties or the rigid enforcement of existing rules that prevents a wrestler from lifting his opponent off the matt or tossing his opponent through the air. In judo, banning the ability of a competitor to hyperex- tend the elbow (or dislocate it) until his opponent taps out (gives up) would likely reduce the risk of elbow injuries in that sport. Targeting the environment Targeting issues of athlete fatigue as well as ensur- ing safe equipment and environment would also reduce the risk of elbow problems. Athletes should be instructed to rest when fatigued. This is especially true when their partner is dependent on their elbow’s strength and function (pairs ﬁ g- ure skating, cheerleading) or when they are partic- ipating in a high energy sport such as gymnastics in which a fall could be catastrophic. Equipment and apparatus should be checked for proper func- tion before competition begins."}
{"id": "510", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "If competition apparatus is unstable or set at the wrong height, it may predispose the athlete to a fall. There is good literature to support that the use of elbow pads in rollerbladers reduces their risk of elbow injuries especially of contusions and abrasions (Schieber et al.,1996; Jerosch et al.,1998; Sheiker & Casell, 1999). Elbow injuries in rollerbladers are most strongly correlated with their willingness to perform advanced tricks and maneuvers. The use of elbow protection in sports at risk of direct contusion such as hockey, lacrosse, or racquet- ball may reduce the risk of these contact injuries. In addition better designs and ﬁ tting with improved shock absorption may assist to a diffuse the load of the more signiﬁ cant direct injuries (Table 10.3). Targeting overuse While avoiding a single catastrophic injury, par- ticularly for the individual athlete, is important, the most effective aim for elbow injury prevention should target the most common injuries; that is, Table 10.3 Injury prevention matrix for elbow injuries: potential measures to prevent injuries.

The foundational knowledge of injury risk, risk factors, and mechanisms should serve as our guide to developing an injury pre- vention plan for the elbow that can be applied to all sports but also one that can be individualized to create a sport-speciﬁ c plan. Athlete’s at risk of elbow injuries due to a history of previous elbow injuries or due to their participation in at risk sports golf, baseball, softball, javelin, tennis, and wrestling should be more thoroughly evaluated on preparticipation physical examinations. The pres- ence of elbow stiffness or pain should be addressed with appropriate therapy prior to release for unre- stricted training. Extension loss of greater than 15º at the elbow or an abnormal carrying angle secondary to development or previous injury will likely lead to abnormal mechanics and future over- use injury. For all overhead and upper extremity dominant athletes, the screening program should also include a thorough assessment of shoulder function and motion. Posterior capsular tightness evidenced by a loss of internal rotation has been directly associated with both shoulder and elbow complaints. Fortunately in a large majority of cases, the shoulder tightness responds to a focused program of capsular stretches including cross-over stretches, internal rotation stretches, and “sleeper” stretches. The latter are performed as the ath- lete lays on his side trapping the effected scapula between his body and the bed followed by inter- nal rotation stretches in various positions. Targeting training When athletes return to play after a signiﬁ cant period of rest or injury, their return should be slow and progressive."}
{"id": "512", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Acute and intense increases in the training regimen at the beginning of the season, prior to major competitions, or during injury recov- ery have been associated with recurrence or over- use injury. A slow progressive recovery program has the best opportunity for successful return to play without recurrence (Tables 10.4, 10.5 and 10.6). In addition to conditioning, coaches should also assure that athletes also have a gradual progression in skills from fundamental to more complex. This plan would avoid the risk of the immature baseball player throwing a curveball with poor mechanics or of the young cheerleader/gymnast attempting a stunt beyond her skill level and risking a cata- strophic fall on her outstretched hand. Targeting the athlete at risk The at-risk athlete should also be screened at the time of his preparticipation examination for coor- dinated movement, strength and symmetry along the entire kinetic chain. Scapular dyskinesia can be assessed by inspecting the athlete from posterior and asking them to protract, retract, and elevate their shoulders with their arms at the sides, hands on their hips, and with their arms abducted 90º (Box 9.1). Any side-to-side asymmetry should be Table 10.4 Interval throwing program: baseball. All throws should be on an arc with a crow hop. Warm-up throws should be 10–20 tosses at 30 ft.

Evaluation of core strength and coordination is also impor- tant. During the preseason screening evaluation, all overhead athletes should be asked to perform a single-legged squat on both a stable and an unsta- ble surface (foam pad, balance board, mini-tramp). The observer should look for poor balance in the upper body with arm swaying or inability to main- tain single leg stance, hyperﬂ exion of the lumbar spine instead of a true knee squat, and gluteal weakness evidenced by knee internal rotation or dropping the contralateral pelvis (Figure 5.7). Any abnormalities discovered should be addressed with focused training and has been shown to reduce the incidence of elbow problems in athletes (Kibler & Sciascia, 2004). Targeting early recognition Educational programs may also target the reduc- tion of injury incidence and severity. Athletes in throwing, weight-bearing and weight-lifting sports need to be educated to offer complaints of elbow pain when present. Delayed diagnosis can lead to poorer prognosis. For example, young gymnasts should never participate in the presence of undiag- nosed pain for fear of making the pathology worse.

{"id": "517", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "168 Chapter 10 Focused, sport-speciﬁ c injury prevention inter- vention plans should target the three most studied sports regarding overuse elbow injuries; golf, ten- nis, and baseball. These plans can easily be trans- lated to other sports using baseball as a model for throwing sports, tennis as a model for racquet sports, and golf as model for stick sports. Targeting golf Golf has a surprisingly high rate of elbow inju- ries, particularly for the amateur athlete (see Table 10.1). The length of the golf club increases the force moment that magniﬁ es the energy that crosses the elbow joint. As noted earlier, this mechanism has been associated with the devel- opment of golfer’s elbow or a tendinopathy on the medial aspect of the elbow. Prevention cent- ers on an increased awareness of the risk as well as improving the mechanics of the golf swing includ- ing impact. Avoid taking large divots. Optimize swing mechanics. Equipment modiﬁ cations may also be helpful with more ﬂ exible shafts to absorb shock, appropriate grips for hand size, and broader head designs with peripheral weighting to maxi- mize the sweet spot. Targeting tennis A majority of elbow injuries related to tennis are related to either repetitive varus forces with active wrist extension during the backhand or repeti- tive valgus extension overload during the serve."}
{"id": "518", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Reduction of the risk of tennis elbow begins with the proper equipment. The grip should not be too small placing the extensors on tension and at risk of injury. For beginners and intermediate level players, high tension racquets are unnecessary for success and may be avoided while skills are advancing. Oversized heads and other equipment designs that help to absorb the shock of impact or assure optimal contact may also be helpful. Counterforce bracing has also been popular to decrease the focal loads on the lateral aspect of the elbow. Many athletes have switched to a two-ﬁ sted backhand because it allows them increased power, more control, and reduced forces over the lateral aspect of the elbow. Athletes with a history of or at risk of tennis elbow should consider switching to a two-ﬁ sted backhand to diminish the loads. The next most common injury pattern in tennis players are related to the repetitive valgus-exten- sion overload that occurs with overheads and the tennis serve. This pattern mimics that seen in throwing athletes. Strains or rupture of the medial collateral ligament, compression injuries of the capitellum, and posterior impingement lesions have been identiﬁ ed just like those seen in base- ball."}

Prevention plans include athlete education to optimize early identiﬁ cation and initiation of treatment; prepar- ticipation screening identifying risks in both the elbow and the shoulder, conditioning programs that focus on every facet of the kinetic chain (Box 10.1). To avoid overuse elbow problems in the skeletally immature, an evaluation of the number of serves, overheads, and backhands performed in a given session or week may be of beneﬁ t. This has clearly been effective in reducing the risk of injury in skeletally immature throwers (Lyman et al.,2002; Dugas, 2006; Olsen et al.,2006). Indeed, there is a good support to this plan in skel- etally immature throwers in little league baseball. Targeting baseball and overhead throwers To begin targeting the throwing athlete, most ath- letes are placed on a routine program of rotator cuff strengthening, scapular stabilization exercises, core strengthening and posterior capsular stretches. Those with deﬁ cits are asked to participate in a supervised program until the deﬁ cits are corrected (Box 10.2). The second key intervention for overhead throw- ers is educating the athlete regarding overuse and monitoring the number of throws they perform and the amount of rest between each outing.

Take-home message The elbow serves an integral role in many sports making the importance of maintaining opti- mal function and avoiding injuries is an impor- tant goal for athletes. Not all elbow injuries, particularly many of the traumatic ones, are avoid- able. Nonetheless, the incidence of those may be reduced by following the rules of play, optimiz- ing equipment, and avoiding fatigue for at risk athletes. The best target for injury prevention of elbow injuries should target the repetitive overuse injuries. For children, reducing exposure by impos- ing pitch counts or throwing limits can reduce the incidence of injury and early identiﬁ cation and rest can prevent them from becoming more severe. A simple rule for coaches of skeletally immature athletes is that they should not play through pain. The return to play for all injured elbows should be gradual and progressive. In thrower’s this is done via a throwing protocol which begins with light tosses and progresses in distance and speed. If the athlete returns too quickly he risks reinjuring his elbow."}

The range of potential head and neck injuries—from facial lacerations to intracranial hemorrhage, from mild neck strains to spinal cord lesions makes this area of injury man- agement particularly difﬁ cult. Fortunately, most sports-related head and neck injuries are mild. However, severe and sometimes fatal injuries do occur which makes the need to prevention of such injuries critical. It is worth also observing that head and neck injuries do not always occur on the sports ﬁ eld; a child spectator died in 2002 after being struck in the head by an ice hockey puck in the United States and in 2001, a track marshal was killed during a Formula 1 championship race. These tragic examples indicate that injury pre- vention must be multi-faceted, addressing, in these cases, the “built” environment, training, and supervision. Pathophysiology of head and neck injury Non-penetrating brain injury (or closed head injury) may be divided into primary and sec- ondary injuries. Primary injury is the result of mechanical forces producing tissue deformation at the moment of injury. These deformations may result in either functional disturbance or structural disruption of cell membranes. The injury may also set in train a complex cascade of biochemical, immunological, or coagulopathic changes that may cause further damage."}

It can be seen that sports where high velocity impacts (e.g., equestrian sports) occur, the risk of head injury is the greatest. Catastrophic head and spinal cord injury Catastrophic head and spinal cord injury occur in virtually all sports. In total 497 persons have died while playing American football in the United States since 1945; of these 69% died from fatal brain injuries and 16% from spinal cord injury (Levy et al.,2004). Data from the US Catastrophic Injury Registry suggests that the incidence of catastrophic head and spinal cord injury has been dropping since the late 1960s and the effect of the introduction of rule changes (e.g., mandatory helmet use, banning spear tackles) in the 1970s led to no appreciable change in the downward trend of injury rates."}

Although this is suggested by retrospective stud- ies and theoretical modeling, no prospective study of rugby spinal cord injury has been performed before and after the introduction of rule changes to reduce scrum-related injury. Studies of “spinal” injury in rugby union demonstrate that the scrum and tackling constitute high risk injury mecha- nisms for non-catastrophic neck injury. However, the number of spinal cord injuries is too low in the study to provide a meaningful statement as to spinal cord injury risk due to these mechanisms (Fuller et al.,2007). Interestingly there is some data to suggest that the spinal cord injury rate dif- fers signiﬁ cantly with age, with schoolboy rugby players having spinal cord injury rates approxi- mately one-third that of adult players. With regard to fatal head injury, the only com- parative data between sports and/or recreational activities was performed in the United Kingdom a number of years ago (Lyens et al.,1984). The ﬁ nd- ings are somewhat surprising insofar as sports that have a perception of high injury risk (e.g., boxing) have surprisingly few fatalities, whereas aquatic sports have relatively high fatality rates (Table 11.2). Most commonly played sports (with the excep- tion of equestrian sports) have relatively low fatal- ity rates and although a fatal event may expose an underlying anatomical or physiological abnormal- ity in the individual concerned there is no conclu- sive evidence that pre-event screening (e.g., MR or CT brain scans in boxers) will prevent fatalities."}

Analysis of the epidemiological literature reveals a number of risk factors, which may be associated with increased risk of sports concussion (Table 11.3). Other than for sports concussion, there is surpris- ingly little published prospective risk factor analy- sis for catastrophic head and neck injury. Injury mechanisms General Head and cervical spine injuries in sport arise mainly due to impacts either with opposing players, the ground or equipment. Participants are exposed to impacts in many sports, for example, football (of all types), projectile sports (cricket, baseball, and hockey), high-speed winter sports, aerial sports (gymnastics), martial arts, and wrestling.

In simple terms, the head and neck are injured due to exposure to forces that exceed the “strength” of the brain, skull, blood vessels, and vertebrae. The magnitudes of the force and/or other relevant char- acteristics, moment, and acceleration, are deter- mined largely by the energy transfer in the impact. Other factors are important such as, anatomi- cal point of impact, the shape and stiffness of the impacted/impacting object, the direction of load- ing; amount of translational and/or angular motion of the head, and, for the neck, the presence of axial loading. The strain that results from these forms of loading is the primary cause of injury. However, strain is difﬁ cult to measure in these situations. The tackle in rugby, Australian and American football, and body checking in ice hockey are asso- ciated with risks of minor to severe impact injury, including spinal cord injury. In rugby, approxi- mately half of all injuries arise in the tackle. Factors that may give rise to injury risks in the tackle include: high tackles; high velocity tack- les; tackles in which the tackler may have been in the peripheral vision of the ball carrier; “big hits” in which the ball carrier is tackled by more than one player (“grapple” tackle is an example of a controversial multiplayer tackle in rugby league) (Figure 11.1); and, a general lack of skill for the tackler."}

The resultant brain injury is related to the magnitude of the impact force, the location of impact and the resultant head and brain accelera- tion. Loading of the skull can deform it leading to fractures, brain contusions, pressure effects, and/or intracranial hemorrhages. Interestingly, biomechanical data from sports head injury studies show that in the majority of impacts the resulting head accelerations are not trivial but they are lower than those observed in motor vehi- cle accidents. Linear head accelerations in the order of 100 g are associated with concussion in sport, whereas the probability of skull fracture or intrac- ranial haemorrhage becomes very high with accel- erations greater than 200 g. Angular acceleration has been associated with axonal injury and bridging vein rupture that leads to subdural hemorrhages. Strain rate and intracranial pressure effects during impacts have also been identiﬁ ed as possible causes of brain injury. These are difﬁ cult to measure directly, but can be approximated using computer simulations.

Examples of sport-speciﬁ c mechanisms are given later. The rugby scrum The rugby scrum has received substantial attention over the years with regard to spinal cord injury. A rugby scrum consists of two opposing packs of eight players divided into the three front row, two back row, and three “loose” forward. The front rows of each team’s scrum pack engage through their heads and shoulders in a forceful driving motion. This can result in high axial compressive neck forces combined with a bending moment and/or shear forces. During the 2003 Rugby World Cup there was one case of cervical dislocation during a scrum engagement that was a career-ending injury. Milburn et al.measured the forces applied to an instrumented scrum machine, and found that the total horizontal forward force on engagement ranged between 4.4 kN for high school players and 8 kN for the Australian national team (Andersen et al.,2004)."}
{"id": "545", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "After the initial engagement, the sus- tained force reduced by approximately 20%. The forces on engagement have the potential to exceed axial neck load and bending moment tolerance lim- its. As a result, scrum laws for under 19 year olds are now designed to eliminate an impact on engage- ment and permit each front row to orient itself well, thus reducing neck loads. No study has reported on the effectiveness of the “under 19 law,” although it is widely viewed as being successful and these principles are inﬂ uencing future developments in the scrum. Head and neck injury prevention Injury prevention methods have been catego- rized under headings drawn from Haddon’s Matrix (Table 11.4). Examples from the literature have been used to demonstrate the effectiveness of each method. For these methods to be successful, they must either be able to minimize the energy involved in impacts and collisions or reduce the forces applied to the body to levels that can be tolerated without injury. In the context of formal sports it is possible to eliminate some injury risks by pre-crash measures; elimination or substitution of hazards, or engineer- ing methods. Sensible removal of structures from the playing ﬁ eld, and the provision of barriers between the playing ﬁ eld and spectators are obvious engi- neering methods for preventing injuries. Administrative controls (Laws and Rules) Rules are one of the most common methods used to prevent injury, however there have been few structured intervention studies that have identi- ﬁ ed the beneﬁ ts associated with speciﬁ c rules."}

Post-injury penalization of players might serve to prevent the illegal play in conjunc- tion with a pre-injury explanation of the rules, their rationale, and development of a safe culture. Body checking in ice hockey, especially involv- ing the head, has led to a concern that this form of contact should be eliminated through rule changes due to its association with head injury. As with spear tackling in American football, which was made illegal, there is a view that the use of helmets has increased hazardous play due to players’ percep- tions that they are at a lower risk of injury, often referred to as risk compensation. In American foot- ball, the intentional use of the helmet or faceguard as the primary point of contact has also been made illegal. Apart from reducing tackle-related injuries through rules, no study has reported on the effects of tackle training as a method for preventing injury. Head injury in football (soccer) has been inves- tigated recently. While heading the ball does not appear to cause concussion per se, the contest for the ball in the air does. During the contest, players can be struck in the head by the opponent’s elbow, shoulder, or head, causing injury (Figure 11.3).

Because of this most “risk factors” are theoretical in their application. Preparticipation screening while commonly advocated relies more on clinical com- mon sense than the weight of scientiﬁ c evidence. One such method for preventing head and neck injury requires participants to undergo medical screening programs to identify players at risk of injury due to anatomical abnormalities (e.g., MR or CT brain scan), pre-existing brain injury (e.g., neuropsychological testing), or genetic markers (e.g., ApoE). Although intuitively sensible, it is important to realize that excluding player partici- pation based on this approach may not be scien- tiﬁ cally or medicolegally defensible. In some situations, congenital spinal canal steno- sis has been postulated as a risk factor for cervical cord injuries.

Furthermore, the risk of future cord injury in an asymptomatic athlete with canal stenosis is unknown at present. Advice regarding the risk of injury in this latter situation is at best anecdotal and no intervention studies are reported in the literature. Training Training to improve strength, ﬁ tness, individual and team skills is an accepted part of sport. While training programs have been shown to reduce lower limb injury, for example, the beneﬁ ts of neck strengthening, skills or ﬁ tness on reducing head and neck injury have not been formally addressed. Considering the high associations between body contact and injury in American football, rugby, and ice hockey, it is possible that skills may theo- retically reduce injury. Improving tackling skills in rugby, for example, head placement, may elimi- nate some accidental head impacts. Skills to track a ball, avoid ball contact, and mishits may also help to reduce neck and head injury, however they have not been formally assessed.

With regard to direct head impacts and concus- sion, various studies have noted signiﬁ cant differ- ences in the impact energy attenuation properties of grass compared to artiﬁ cial surfaces. Personal protective equipment: helmets Helmets and padded headgear are used in many projectile and contact sports to prevent head injury. Recent published meta-analysis studies of pedal cycle helmets in transport and recreation have conﬁ rmed the fact that light weight helmets are effective in pre- venting head and facial injuries in cyclists. In some sporting competitions it has become man- datory to wear a helmet and/or faceguard, for exam- ple, baseball, softball, American football, ice hockey, as well as competitive alpine skiing and snowboard- ing. Helmets in American football and ice hockey have evolved from padded headgear to helmets comprising a hard shell, a liner, and a faceguard. Canadian and NOCSAE standards for ice hockey and football helmets, respectively, were established in the early 1970s. Recently, there has been much debate over the use of padded headgear in soccer. Helmets are designed to attenuate the impact energy and distribute the impact force applied to the head. If a helmet can reduce the head impact force and head’s acceleration to below relevant tol- erance levels and under sport-speciﬁ c impact sce- narios, then a helmet can function to reduce the risk of brain injury."}
{"id": "551", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "The results of published studies show that all of the currently available commercial padded headgear for rugby and Australian football has a very limited ability to reduce concussive impact forces based on existing head injury models. Even if the more gen- erous injury thresholds are applied to the data, all headgear tested lose any protective capacity once the impact energy is greater than 20 J. This is reﬂ ected in randomized controlled trials of headgear in rugby and Australian football showing a lack of efﬁ cacy in concussion prevention with soft-shell helmets. Studies of the effectiveness of helmets in sports where the use (other than in alpine racing) is not mandatory are emerging (Table 11.5). While alpine sport injuries appear to be increas- ing over time, the use of helmets to prevent head injuries is associated with a 22–60% reduction in head injury rates (McCrory & Turner, 2005). The greatest limitations to the widespread application of protective helmets in these sports are the lack of an internationally accepted helmet standard, the availability of helmets and the variable ﬁ tting of helmets, especially with children.

Interestingly, since helmets were made compulsory for profes- sional jockeys in 1993–1994, no signiﬁ cant changes in concussion rates have been observed. The num- bers of fatal brain injuries over the same time period are too small to be adequately analyzed in this regard. Indirect evidence exists that head protectors may play a role in injury reduction at least in non- professional equestrian riders. Both United States and United Kingdom data showed a ﬁ vefold drop in horse-related injury presentations between 1971 and 1992, due largely to a reduction in head injury presentation. Although not a causal relationship, this change was associated with an increase in helmet use over the same time period.

Studies of the effectiveness of cricket helmets have been conﬁ ned to the laboratory and indicate that the level of protection is greatly reduced with high-speed ball impacts.

Neck muscle strengthening It is often suggested that neck muscle condition- ing may be of value in reducing impact forces transmitted to the brain. Biomechanical concepts dictate that the energy from an impacting object is dispersed over the greater mass of an athlete if the head is held rigidly. Although attractive from a theoretical standpoint, there is little scientiﬁ c support for this viewpoint and no prospective published studies to support this approach. Video analysis of concussive injury seen in Australian football, rugby and soccer demonstrates that approximately 95% of concussive impacts are an accidental part of play and the players concerned were unaware of impending impact and hence unable to tense their neck muscles in an attempt to withstand the impact. This same issue may apply to protecting the spine. Secondary injury prevention: post-impact measures The role of injury prevention in the post-impact phase has not been adequately addressed in the published literature. It is intuitively likely that correct ﬁ rst-aid or paramedical management will reduce the risk of head or spinal cord injury com- plications. The management of the concussion or mild traumatic brain injury itself at best follows expert consensus guidelines (Level III evidence) in the absence of scientiﬁ cally tested management strategies.

Optimal tendon function is required for optimal perform- ance. Tendons are subjected to large mechanical forces during movement but healthy tendons are well adapted to this peak demand. Despite this peak load tolerance, tendon overuse injury (tendinopathy) is one of the most frequent injuries among elite and recreational athletes. Such overuse injuries most often affect tendons such as the Achilles, patellar, or supraspinatus tendon (Table 12.1). In sports characterized by forceful and explo- sive muscle contractions, the prevalence of patellar tendinopathy can reach 45–55% in populations of jumping athletes such as elite volleyball and bas- ketball players. The prevalence of Achilles tendin- opathy is also considerable in a variety of different sports such as running (about 10% of all athletes) and different ball games (e.g., football). Overuse injuries in the upper limb occur in athletes (throw- ing and racquet sports), but are also prevalent in an older population, particularly manual workers. Overuse tendon injury presents as tendon pain, but tendon pathology and tendon pain can develop independently; pathology appears to precede pain in most cases. Tendons that rupture are often painfree, but have an extensive pathology and the force imposed on them is greater than the tendon integrity (Kannus & Jozsa, 1991)."}

Then we review the etiology of tendinopathy and propose oppor- tunities for injury prevention. Basic tendon structure All muscles basically have two tendons, a short one at their proximal end (origin of muscle) and a somewhat longer one at their distal end (insertion of muscle) underlining that the mechanical proper- ties of the tendons will have a great impact upon the function of the entire muscle–tendon–bone complex. Tendons and muscles join, and integrate, at the myotendinous junction—the site where the tendon inﬁ ltrates or interdigitates the muscle body to provide a large contact surface between the two structures. Distally, the tendon joins bone in the osteotendinous junction, a complex transition from soft to hard tissue. Because the muscle–ten- don junction is primarily affected in a muscle strain injury, we will not consider the structure and func- tion of the myotendinous junction in this chapter. The structural design of different tendons varies substantially; some are short and thick, and oth- ers long and thin. Structure depends on the spe- ciﬁ c function of each tendon. Long tendons, such as the Achilles tendon, provide the body with energy-returning springs so that movement is energy efﬁ cient. Short, broad tendons, such as the quadriceps tendon, serve as pure force-transducers for their attached muscles."}

Together, the collagen and the ground substance are called the extracellular matrix. The various components of the extracellular matrix are produced by the tendon cells (tenocytes, specialized ﬁ broblasts) that are elongated spindle-shaped cells and are located between the collagen ﬁ brils (Figure 12.1). If you were to digest tendon collagen ﬁ brils down to their core component you would come across triple helical collagen molecules. The individual collagen molecules inside the ﬁ brils are intercon- nected and stabilized by cross-links thereby secur- ing the force transduction along the ﬁ bril from one end of tendon to the other. Although there are more than 20 different collagen proteins, tendons predominantly consist of ﬁ brillar type I collagen as well as smaller amounts of other collagen types including type II, III, and V. The various collagen molecules exhibit different mechanical properties and the general mechanical properties and func- tion of the whole tendon is therefore highly inﬂ u- enced by the distribution of collagen types. The matrix between the collagen ﬁ brils is com- prised of proteoglycans that are important for the alignment of collagen ﬁ bers. Proteoglycans are hydrophilic (attract water, hence the “swelling” in injured tendons, see later) and composed of polysaccharide chains of glycosaminoglycans that are bound to protein cores. Proteoglycans act as glue between the various collagen networks binding Figure 12.1. Bundles of type I collagen ﬁ brils provide the load-bearing element of tendon (left side of the illustration)."}

Proteoglycans also regulate matrix assembly and sta- bilize the extracellular matrix architecture. Further, proteoglycans control the hydration of the extra- cellular matrix and spacing between collagen ﬁ brils and they bind various growth factors to regulate the tendon milieu. Together with other glycoproteins such as elastin, ﬁ bronectin, and laminin, the colla- gen and ground substance create a meshwork that does not rely on single molecules but rather on the polymers and networks that the molecules create. The architecture of the tendon The structural properties of the collagen ﬁ bril determine the mechanical properties of the ten- don. This means that small ﬁ brils increase the elas- tic properties and larger ﬁ brils increase the strength via greater cross-sectional area and increased num- bers of intramolecular cross-links. Approximately 95% of the ﬁ bers run longitudinally with the ten- don orientation. Tendon ﬁ brils can span the entire tendon length which implies that the tendon mechanical properties including strength and stiff- ness are highly dependent upon the dimensions and composition of the single ﬁ brils. However, other factors such as collagen-type distribution, inter- and intra-ﬁ brillar interactions as well as total tendon cross-section are important for the overall function and strength of tendons. The intraﬁ brillar cross-linking of collagen mol- ecules is an important mechanism for integrity between collagen molecules that contribute to the strength and force-transducing capability of the tendon ﬁ bril."}
{"id": "570", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Increased cross-linking increases tendon stiffness and elastic modulus, reduces the failure strain but does not appear to signiﬁ cantly affect rupture stress. Tendons in older individuals have an increase in non-enzymatic cross-linking in the form of glycation (incorporation of sugar) and this increases tendon stiffness. Several collagen ﬁ brils combine to make up a tendon ﬁ ber (Figure 12.1). Bundles of ﬁ bers surrounded by connective tissue (endotenon) comprise a fascicle bundle. The endotenon sur- rounding the collagen ﬁ bers and fascicles carries blood vessels, nerve ﬁ bers, and lymphatics into the tendon. Loose connective tissue (epitenon) surrounds the whole tendon. In areas where ten- dons slide relative to adjacent tissues the tendon may also be enveloped by another loose connec- tive tissue sheet called the paratenon. Together, the epitenon and paratenon is called the periten- don and these structures allow the tendon to glide with minimal resistance during movement. The area where the tendon inserts into bone is the highly specialized “osteotendinous junc- tion.”Here, the viscoelastic tendinous tissue transfers force to the rigid bone, and there is a gradual change in the mechanical properties that is achieved by transition through four consecutive structural zones; the tendon zone, ﬁ brocartilage, mineralized ﬁ brocartilage, and bone."}

Although a thin and long tendon will assist energy storage and release, it may be more vulnerable to injury. A thicker tendon, which would yield less strain energy, would reduce the stress across the tendon and thereby provides the tendon with a greater safety margin. Thus, from an injury pre- vention standpoint a presumably healthy (physi- ological) hypertrophic tendon adaptation to exercise would be advantageous since it will reduce the amount of stress on the tendon. Unquestionably, tendons are remarkably strong, a tendon with a cross-sectional area of 1 cm2 (approx- imately corresponding to a normal adult patellar tendon) will be able to withstand a tensile load of 10,000 N or 1000 kg—perhaps 10–15 times body weight. The strength of tendons is related to the cross-sectional area (number and thickness of par- allel ﬁ brils) of the tendon and the tensile quality of the tendinous tissue (related to factors such as intraﬁ brillar cross-links and collagen type distribu- tion). In other words, the greater the cross-sectional area, number of cross-links and type I collagen content of a given tendon, the greater loads can be withstood by the tendon before failure occurs if all other factors are equal. The tensile strength of a non-injured tendon is normally several times higher than the strength of its attached muscle leaving most tendons with a substantial tensile safety mar- gin. However this may not be the case for all ten- dons during all circumstances. Patellar tendon forces have been estimated to be as high as 8000 N during landing and 9000 N during sprinting and tendon loads in the human Achilles tendon reach 9000 N during running."}
{"id": "573", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Thus, some tendons, including the patellar and especially the Achilles, may operate close to their maximal strength tolerance. Tendon adaptation to loading Mechanical loading stimulates collagen production dramatically—a single bout of exercise doubles the synthesis rate of collagen, and maintains this elevated level for 2–3 days. This increased synthe- sis is dose- or intensity-dependent. In short-term exercise, collagen degradation is also elevated, resulting in little overall gain in collagen production. Figure 12.3. Stress strain curve. There is a “toe” region where strain can increase with little increase in stress. Then there is a “plastic” region where increased strain causes a linear increase in stress.

When testing human tendons in vivo, strain lev- els at maximal isometric muscle contractions have ranged 7–18% depending on the tendon inves- tigated. However, the “single strain” condition is not the only way that tendons can be injured. In sportspeople, tendons are mostly subjected to repeated or prolonged loading. This can cause fatigue damage, even though each single loading is well below the maximal strength of the ten- don—this is deﬁ ned as fatigue damage. Although a completely stiff structure would pro- vide the most efﬁ cient force transduction from muscle to bone, tendons are quite elastic. Thus, when a tendon is loaded and elongated, tendon force is built up, and energy is stored within the tendon. This stored energy can be released from the tendon and utilized to create or prevent joint movement. This process conserves energy and improves efﬁ ciency of locomotion. It is estimated"}

These new ﬁ ndings indicate that tendon tissue responds much more dynamically to loading than previously thought and that intermittent loading could cause a negative balance between new colla- gen formation and collagen degradation. Also, the fact that matrix protein formation is already ele- vated after one acute bout of exercise and remains elevated for around 48 h after exercise indicates that from “a matrix point of view,” it would be sufﬁ cient to train every other day to optimally stimulate matrix tissue of the tendon. Thus, the apparent mismatch between how quickly tissues such as skeletal and heart muscle adapt to load- ing, and how frequently such tissues tolerate the training stimulus, and the fact that connective tis- sue such as the tendon has a more “delayed” and slower adaptation pattern, may explain why ten- don can be the weak link in situations of intense training or overloading. Although physical training is associated with a chronic elevation of collagen turnover, it is not clear to what extent this leads to net collagen syn- thesis and tendon growth. Although trained men (but not trained women) have greater Achilles tendon cross-sectional area than their untrained counterparts, 9 months of running training did not increase the cross-sectional area of the Achilles tendon. As training strengthens tendon mechani- cally, it is likely that several factors other than just the amount of collagen in the tendon are impor- tant in the training-induced adaptation of healthy tendon in humans. Some investigators have suggested that endur- ance training results in qualitative changes (improved tissue mechanics) but not quantitative (increased tendon size) changes, whereas other investigators have concluded that tendons react to endurance training by both quantitative and qual- itative augmentations. Tendon pathology Tendon pathology induces dramatic changes in ten- don structure, with changes in both the cells and the extracellular matrix that results in poorer mechanical properties and capacity to sustain load. The matrix changes are extensive and responsible for the fundamental decrease in load-bearing capacity of the tendon."}

Collagen is disrupted, and altered in type from type I to smaller diameter ﬁ bers of type II, and III, and there is an increase in vascularity and neural ingrowth to the tendon (Figure 12.4). Overall, it seems that extracellular matrix home- ostasis is important to maintain normal tendon function and that disruptions of the matrix bal- ance is an early sign or mechanism in tendon injury development. We still lack a biomarker in human tendon that can provide an early warning sign of emerg- ing overloading of the tendon. Clinically, tendon pathology can be detected by abnormal imaging (ultrasound or MR) (Figure 12.5). However, the correlation between pain and abnormal imaging is poor; tendons with abnormal imaging are not always painful, likewise tendons that appear nor- mal to imaging can be painful. Mechanism of tendon overuse injury Despite the high incidence and prevalence of tend- inopathies the exact etiology remains elusive. It is, however, generally accepted that overuse injuries are related to repetitive tensile loading and strain of the tendon. Thus, a tendon overuse injury implies an injury in response to repeated strains above a certain threshold. The response is driven by cell detection of load that causes increased pro- tein production in the cell."}

This reminds us of the ﬁ ne line between optimal loading for adapta- tion and loading that puts the tissue under too much reparative stress. It could be suggested that the tendon ﬁ broblast increases protein synthe- sis in response to mechanical loading, but that this cannot increase further with higher-intensity exercise. This might explain why too much exer- cise (e.g., excessive jumping) can result in a sub- optimal adaptation of the tendon and subsequent tendinopathy. The development of tendinopathy may also be related to the structural properties of the tendons. Both the Achilles tendon and the patellar tendon have a non-uniform cross-sectional area distribu- tion along their length and that the regions where tendinopathy most often occur in these tendons have the narrowest cross-sectional area. Thus, ten- don overload injuries may arise at sites of stress concentrations (high force per area) in the tendons at these speciﬁ c regions. However, it is unlikely that tendon stress is the sole factor in the etiology of tendinopathies. The majority of tendinopathies occur in the tendon closer to the attachment to bone. The tissue at the osteotendinous junction display inferior modulus and maximum stress com- pared to mid-tendon tissue."}

Younger tendons are also vulnerable to tendon pathology and in the adolescent population the prevalence of patellar tendon pathology in jump- ing athletes is similar to adults. At all ages, over- load can produce pain in an already pathological tendon. Sex The prevalence of lower limb tendinopathy appears to be less in sporting women than among men with comparable training history, men have twice the risk of developing tendon pathology and pain compared to women (Lian et al.,2005). Possible reasons for this difference require investigation. Candidate hypotheses include that (i) men with larger muscles may be able to impose greater loads on their tendons, or subject them to more loading cycles, (ii) women’s and men’s tendons have differ- ent capacities to adapt to an increased or decreased loading, or, (iii) sex hormones may play a key role in tendon pathogenesis. Genes Researchers have unraveled the relationship between Achilles tendinopathy and genes for two proteins: tenascin-C and type V collagen. Certain types of genes (polymorphisms) in both the tenascin-C and collagen V genes were associated with Achilles tendinopathy and this association has been conﬁ rmed in a second population.

This study reported that waist circumfer- ence in males of greater than 83 cm resulted in a 74% probability of morphological tendon abnor- malities (via ultrasound), whereas males with waist of less than 83 cm had a 15% probability of tendon changes (Malliaras et al.,2007). Body mass index has been associated with onset of tendinopathy. Nineteen out of 41 studies in a systematic review showed a signiﬁ cant association with adiposity and tendon health."}

Further research is needed to identify the mechanisms for such associations, but like other musculoskeletal conditions it is likely that the mechanisms are more complex than just an increase in load on the tendon (Pottie et al.,2006). Range of joint movement A decreased range of ankle dorsiﬂ exion range of movement is associated with both Achilles and patellar tendon pathology, and is likely to relate to increased tendon forces with landing. Interestingly, plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendinopathy have been also associated with an increased range of dorsiﬂ exion. Chronic disease Glycation cross-links are increased in subjects with diabetes, making tendons stiffer and more prone to overload.

These diseases have systemic and familial links, as does diabetes (especially type 1). In addition, type 2 diabetes is associated with increased abdominal adiposity, and interac- tions between risk factors for tendinopathy have not been clariﬁ ed. Muscle strength and ﬂ exibility Muscle strength of the attached muscle has not been clearly shown to be a factor in the onset of tendon pathology. Athletes who can jump higher have more patellar tendon pathology in some studies (Lian et al.,2003), other studies do not support this (Malliaras & Cook, 2006). Reduced muscle ﬂ exibility has been shown to be associated with patellar tendinopathy, both the hamstrings and quadriceps have been implicated (Witvrouw et al.,2001). Other factors The amount of loading has been shown to be associated with patellar tendon pain and pathol- ogy.

{"id": "585", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "1984). Take-home message Athletes who load heavily with training in sports and have a big energy storage and release com- ponent are vulnerable to tendon pathology. Each sport has its own collection of vulnerable tendons: the patellar tendon in jumping athletes, Achilles in running and court sports, and the adductor tendons in football players. This vulnerability is ameliorated or enhanced in individuals by intrin- sic risk factors and a range of other unknown factors. Coaches are well aware that two athletes can train identically yet one will develop tendon pathology and pain and the other will remain symptom-free. Although we can identify tendon pathology clinically with imaging, this does not allow us to predict which athletes will develop pain, and of these, which will develop pain sufﬁ cient to stop participation. At best, imaging might allow the coach or medical practitioner to be aware of which athletes are at risk (Fredberg et al.,2007), plan training so overload is minimal, and monitor and modify tendon load as necessary. Although this is far from satisfactory, tendon pain and path- ology remain outside the injuries that can be easily controlled. Preventing tendon overuse injuries Because tendon pathology appears to result from an interaction between several individual and environmental risk factors, prevention is not merely a matter of following a single recipe for all athletes."}
{"id": "586", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "A tendon that is not overloaded will not develop tendinopathy—it appears that repeated stretch-shortening cycles with body weight over time are required to generate tendon pathology and pain. However, as individuals appear to have a wide variation in load tolerance, it is not currently possible to provide “research evidence” for a nar- row, deﬁ ned load that minimizes risk of tendon overuse injury. Adaptation to loading The ability of tendinous tissue to respond to mechanical loading of the muscle–tendon unit is of great interest as inadequate adaptations may promote the development of injury and an ade- quate adaptation may reduce the risk of tendinop- athy despite substantial tendon loading. Tendinous tissue has traditionally been regarded as rather sluggish and static with a limited abil- ity to react and adapt to exercise and training. However research has shown that tendinous tissue is highly capable of adjusting its metabolism to match an increase in loading and that the tissue can adapt to training. Interestingly, also in tendi- nopathic tendons, regular exercise does result in an upregulation of collagen synthesis, indicating that even in a diseased state, tendons beneﬁ t from a certain degree of controlled loading (Langberg et al.,2007)."}

Patellar tendon hypertro- phy occurs in response to 12 weeks of heavy resist- ance training the increase in cross-sectional area occurred at the proximal and distal ends but not at the mid-tendon (Kongsgaard et al.,2007). This is supported by a study that showed high-resistance training reduced tendon pain (Frohm et al.,2007). Speciﬁ c types of exercise: eccentric training Eccentric exercise places high load on tendon and it has been used extensively to rehabilitate pain- ful tendons (Kingma et al.,2007). Its use as a pre- vention has been investigated only recently and a study of soccer players has shown that it did not reduce the risk of injury. In fact those with patellar tendon pathology at the beginning of the season were more likely to be injured if they did the pre- ventative eccentric exercise (Fredberg et al.,2007)."}
{"id": "588", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "In a similar study in volleyball players, eccentric training in season did not improve tendon pain (Visnes et al.,2005). Stretching Stretching is used to prevent injury, in tendons the type of stretching may be critical. Dynamic stretching may be superior to static stretching as it alters the mechanical properties of the tendons (Witvrouw et al.,2007), whereas static stretching in many tendinopathies will increase the compres- sive load, known to cause pathological alterations in tendons. In athletes although static stretching may be relevant for the muscle, the best tendon response is to dynamic stretching. Adjusting training load Although overload has been clearly linked to ten- don pain and pathology, athletes have widely rang- ing load tolerance. Thus, we are unable to prescribe simple protocols for adjusting load. However, energy storage and release causes tendon pathology, hence it is easy to say if you cycle or swim you are unlikely to get a tensional tendon overload (swimmers may get compressive overload of the rotator cuff). Outside of this recommendation, load management becomes more difﬁ cult, frequency of load appears important; training more than once in every 2 days does not allow the tendon to respond fully to each load stim- ulus."}
{"id": "589", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Nothing is known about modifying volume and intensity of load. A recent study that investi- gated gradual introduction of running compared to a standard running training program did not ﬁ nd any difference in injury between groups, because of indi- vidual variations in injury susceptibility very large numbers in such studies may be needed to clearly show if a difference exists (Buist et al.,2008). Take-home message Because tendon’s response to different kinds of exercise and loading varies, coaches cannot follow “one-size ﬁ ts all” approach. Tendons possess adap- tational capabilities and in most circumstances will adapt adequately to different levels of exer- cise if they are given enough time. However, as tendinous tissue is somewhat slower to adapt than muscle tissue it is suggested that sudden increases or changes in exercise loads and modes should be avoided wherever possible. It would appear pru- dent for training changes to be prescribed cau- tiously to allow the tendon enough time to adapt and recover and prevent the development of injury. Abdominal fat, lack of ﬁ tness, and certain biomechanical factors are risk factors for overuse tendinopathy so these should be addressed in active individuals. Imaging (including ultrasound and MR imaging) does not appear to contribute to the clinical approach to tendinopathy prevention at this stage. References Arøen, A., Helgø, D., Granlund, O.

Moreover, in combination with a proper diet and a healthy lifestyle, physical activ- ity is an inﬂ uential factor in the control of body weight. From a public health perspective, the ben- eﬁ ts of physical activity are clear. There is, however, a cost of physical activity— namely the burden of injuries. Injuries resulting from sports and recreational activities are a sig- niﬁ cant health problem in many countries. There is now irrefutable evidence that the sports injury problem is not restricted to professional sports. For more than two decades, about every ﬁ fth unin- tentional injury treated in a health care setting in industrialized countries has been associated with sports or physical activity. This makes sport and recreational activity injuries probably the most ironic injury type. On one side, public health authorities are actively promoting regular sport and physical activity participation. On the other hand, it is known that if not practiced in safe environments, sport and recreational activity inju- ries could signiﬁ cantly reduce the public health beneﬁ ts of regular sport and physical activity participation."}

These key elements are as follows. Approach the injury problem at hand with a multi-dimensional view It is essential to analyze any injury problem through a systematic approach and a multi-dimensional view (see Chapter 2). It maximizes the prob- ability that all possible solutions to the problem will be addressed. Based on some of the latest conceptual advances made in the ﬁ eld of injury prevention, we also suggest that the following guiding principles be considered in the analy- sis process: (1) Consider the cost/beneﬁ t ratio when selecting an intervention strategy; (2) con- sider the impact an intervention might have on the nature of the sport; (3) choose interventions adapted to the problem at hand: either inform, convince, or contrive (see Section “Active versus passive measures” in Chapter 2); and (4) Encourage partnership.

You need well-documented facts on the injury problem as well as the effects of the proposed measures before trying to convince the targeted group—whether it be elite athletes, rec- reational participants or owners of sport facilities. Work toward a consensus; develop coalitions Even if you are in a position to impose mandatory safety measures, make sure you develop strong grass-roots support for your intervention. As a sport injury prevention specialist, identify the key stakeholders and work with them on solutions that they are willing to apply. Be prepared to support these partners with information and training. Recognize the limits of information campaigns; develop back-up technological systems Public awareness campaigns are important, but they are not enough. Well-informed people are still human beings; which means that knowledge does not necessarily result in behavior change. One of the most efﬁ cient ways to improve sports safety is through the modiﬁ cation of the environ- ment (see Section “Active versus passive measures” in Chapter 2). Try to change the perception that more safety brings less fun Safety is often perceived as something that will take fun away from sport and recreational activities. In fact, safety measures can allow participants more enjoyment from their activity by giving them “peace of mind.”"}

The aim of this chapter is to present ﬁ ve prac- tical examples of large-scale programs that have been implemented by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the United States of America, by the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) in New Zealand, and by the provincial government in the Canadian province of Québec. Each example will incorporate the ﬁ ve key elements previously discussed within the context of the four step injury prevention model (IPM): (1) describing the magnitude of the injury problem, (2) understanding the causes, (3) intro- ducing measures likely to reduce the future risk and/or severity of injuries, and (4) evaluating their effect (Figure 2.1).

The American National Collegiate Athletic Association model The NCAA is an organization of approximately 1100 colleges and universities established in 1906 to govern athletics competition in a fair, safe, equi- table, and sportsmanlike manner and to integrate intercollegiate athletics into higher education. The association conducts its business through a com- mittee structure made up of diverse representatives from member institutions. Nationally, more than 380,000 student–athletes participate in NCAA sports that offer national championships. Recognizing its organizational health and safety roots, the NCAA has maintained an Injury Surveillance System (ISS) for intercollegiate ath- letics since 1982."}

All were in the presence of coaches. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC, 1998) review of the cases, the wrestlers were attempting to lose an average of 8 pounds over a 3- to 12-h period by wearing rub- ber suits and exercising vigorously in hot environ- ments. The wrestlers were attempting to lose this weight AFTER dropping an average 21 pounds over the previous 2–3 months. There were no previous recorded deaths in NCAA wrestling associated with making weight but the sport in general had a reputation for rapid and severe weight ﬂ uctuations similar to those reported in these three cases. Understanding the facts and the belief structure (IPM Steps 1 and 2) The sport of wrestling had a variety of issues to consider before addressing the problem.1. Established guidelines: Position statements associated with weight loss in wrestling from organizations such as the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM, 1996) had existed for many years. The three deaths brought attention to weight loss behaviors that, in some cases, had been contrary to medical guidelines for many years.2."}
{"id": "602", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Safety: The NCAA ISS had shown wrestling as a sport at very high risk for injury relative to other sports monitored by the system (Agel et al.,2007). Many of the injuries may have been directly or indirectly associated with improper weight loss practices or their after-effects.3. Competitive equity: Weight was acknowledged to be the competitive equity variable in the sport of wrestling. Weight classes were established to assure that opponents were paired against athletes of similar weight. Prior to these fatalities, collegiate wrestlers were able to make weight at least 24 h prior to competition, When the actual competition took place, both opponents generally weighed signiﬁ cantly more than the designated weight class they had qualiﬁ ed for the previous day (mean 3.3 kg in one study;Horswill et al.,1994). There also could be a signiﬁ cant weight differential between the two individuals (mean 1.5 kg in one study; Scott et al.,1994) nullifying any competitive equity associated with weight class."}
{"id": "603", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "4. Wrestler mindset: Wrestlers believed that self- discipline, commitment and sacriﬁ ce they learned from making weight would help make them better wrestlers. Cutting 3–7% body weight and then regaining it the next day was perceived to allow one to gain a strength and size advantage over a “smaller/weaker” opponent. Working toward consensus: identifying the stakeholders In the aftermath of the wrestling deaths, the NCAA joined with other organizations to create a joint resolution which said, in part: “Eliminate from wres- tling any and all weight control practices which could potentially risk the health of the participants.”Two NCAA committees, the National Wrestling Coaches Association, USA Wrestling, the national governing body for wrestling and various medi- cal organizations were involved in the discussions. Coaches, student-athletes, exercise physiologists, athletic trainers, physicians, athletic administrators, sport governing body ofﬁ cials, and lawyers were all represented. Since weight cutting mostly occurred in the practice environment, and could not be regu- lated effectively by competition rules, the wrestling coach was identiﬁ ed as a key stakeholder. While cer- tain policies could be implemented and enforced, the wrestling coach, and his or her attitude toward weight cutting leading up to competitions, ulti- mately would determine the success of the program. NCAA weight management program components (IPM Step 3) The NCAA weight management program (Figure 13.1) was based on four guiding principles: • Enhance safety and competitive equity • Minimize incentives for rapid weight loss"}
{"id": "604", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "200 Chapter 13 • Emphasize competition, not weight control • Implement practical, effective, and enforceable guidelines. Speciﬁ c components included: establishing weight classes that better reﬂ ect the collegiate wrestling pop- ulation, establishing a permanent healthy weight class (lean body weight plus at least 5% body fat) early in the season with time to achieve it safely, establishing weigh-ins as close to the match as pos- sible, eliminating the tools used to accomplish rapid dehydration, and requiring CPR certiﬁ cation of all wrestling coaches. Evaluation of the weight management program (IPM Step 4) To evaluate effectiveness, research investigating the changes in weight and body composition relative to performance over the course of the season was initiated. Research conducted over the entire wres- tling season showed that the most successful wres- tlers chose to participate at a body composition well above the minimum allowable value of 5% and that reducing the time between weigh-ins and competition was effective in reducing rapid weight loss. A weight management program coupled with reducing time between weigh-ins and competition was even more effective. Discussion The successful NCAA model includes injury sur- veillance (facts), input from diverse constitu- ents (consensus), a committee structure with the capability to enact and enforce formal policy, and speciﬁ c research to determine policy effectiveness. The NCAA wrestling weight management program has become a model program for the sport and has been accepted by collegiate wrestlers and coaches. The sport has become more fun for participants as the emphasis has switched from weight loss to skill development. In the 2004–2005 academic year, this program involved 224 intercollegiate wrestling programs, touching almost 6000 stu- dent-athletes. In 2006 the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) imple- mented a similar weight management program at the United States high school level impacting over 250,000 student-athletes."}

A simi- lar weight management program may be beneﬁ cial at higher levels of wrestling and in other Olympic weight category sports such as rowing and boxing. The New Zealand model In New Zealand, determining the size and scope of a particular sport injury problem is relatively simple. This is largely due to the existence of a mandatory no-fault 24-h injury scheme providing coverage for injury treatment and rehabilitation costs. The scheme is administered by the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). In the last ACC ﬁ nancial year (1 July 2006 to 20 June 2007—2006/2007), the 4.1 million New Zealanders made 422,000 sport and recreation claims, costing the Corporation $NZ 329 million. There is no disincentive for making a claim; people are not discriminated, risk rated or penal- ized for the number of claims they make. The cost of claims and the legislation governing the ACC pro- vides incentive for investing in large-scale injury pre- vention programs. ACC has a cost-outcome model to determine investment levels and programs are expected to provide a return on the investment. ACC currently targets moderate to serious injury claims for its sport cost-outcome model."}

This initiative relies on a coalition between ACC and the respective national sporting body. Two speciﬁ c applications of the SportSmart model are discussed in the following section. Example 2: The RugbySmart Program— preventing injuries in rugby union The injury problem (Steps 1 and 2) Rugby Union (rugby) represents the largest per- centage (15%) of sport moderate to serious injury claims to ACC. It is also a sport that has been asso- ciated with serious spinal injuries. Due to their severity and life changing impact, these injuries draw media attention and focus on to rugby. In 1996, the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) implemented a compulsory safety course for coaches and referees, with the focus on preventing serious spinal injuries. Analysis of the compulsory safety course showed that it was not achieving the desired effect, despite early reported results. In 2000, ACC and NZRU formed a coalition to tackle the injuries. ACC data identiﬁ ed neck/back/spine, shoulder, knee, ankle, and leg (excluding knee and ankle) injuries to target in addition to serious spinal injuries."}

Understanding the facts and belief structure While there was acknowledgment that the inci- dence of serious spinal injuries needed attention, the NZRU compulsory safety course was widely viewed as undesirable and was not well received by the rugby community. Common reasons included: 1. Coaches/referees were volunteers and were difﬁ cult to recruit; having to undertake a compulsory safety course was yet another commitment on the coaches time.2. The focus was on the consequences of a serious injury. Highlighting the problem had the potential to turn people away from coaching/refereeing.3."}

In summary, a system to deliver compulsory safety education was in place but it needed to be made more suitable to the audience to achieve buy-in and acceptance. Working toward consensus: identifying the stakeholders By developing a coalition, both groups could achieve appropriate outcomes. ACC desired a reduction in the number of injuries, as it provided for the cost of rehabilitation and replacement of earnings, whereas the NZRU wanted to make the game a competitive, safe, and popular sport.

The NZRU com- pulsory safety course evolved to RugbySmart and was repackaged to focus more on causes of injury rather than consequences. In addition to NZRU and Rugby Development Ofﬁ cers, coaches and referees also were identiﬁ ed as stakeholders. RugbySmart targeted coaches and referees as (i) reaching 137,000 players via coaches/referees was more effective than targeting each player directly and more effective than relying on clubs and schools and (ii) coaches were identiﬁ ed by both players (and coaches) as having an important role in injury prevention. The RugbySmart program (Step 3) RugbySmart involves the screening of a DVD at a compulsory workshop, as originally put in place by NZRU. The DVD contained aspects of the 10-point action plan, with an emphasis on areas where injury issues have been identiﬁ ed, such as the scrum, tackle, and ruck (Figure 13.3). The workshop was conducted by Rugby Development Ofﬁ cers (for coaches) and Referee Education Ofﬁ cers (for ref- erees), and these positions were funded by NZRU. Having a DVD ensured consistency of delivery and supported the facilitator. RugbySmart, like its NZRU predecessor was compulsory for coaches and referees to attend. Team were withdrawn from competition and referees were not assigned games if they did not attend."}
{"id": "611", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "While the compulsory edu- cation aspect was appealing to ACC and ensured a captive audience, it also created resistance to the program. This was largely overcome by develop- ing a product that appealed to the coaches and ref- erees. For example, promoting correct or winning technique as safe and then demonstrating skills that focused on the improved technique was a suc- cessful strategy. The skills demonstrated were in a straightforward manner, allowing coaches to mas- ter them and easily incorporate into trainings. Evaluation of the RugbySmart program (Step 4) RugbySmart was evaluated in several ways and the results were used to develop the program further, keeping it fresh and relevant. NZRU is one of the few sports in NZ to have an accurate and reliable player registration system, providing a moderate to serious injury claims rate per 100,000 players to determine the effectiveness of RugbySmart. Evaluation justi- ﬁ ed continued investment in the existing program as well as in further areas that warrant investiga- tion. The return on the investment was $7:78 for every ACC $1 invested (Gianotti & Hume, 2007).

Football was targeted as it represented the second largest percentage of sport claims (7.2%) to ACC. While ACC and New Zealand Football (NZF) had previously developed some injury prevention initiatives, they were small and involved using the generic SportSmart model rather than a football- speciﬁ c one. Attention was also focussed on sec- ondary/tertiary prevention (e.g., training for the treatment of soft-tissue injuries). The ACC system could, like in rugby, pinpoint the type and nature of football injuries. Initially the focus was all moderate to serious soccer injury claims. However, in 2005 the system targeted players aged 15–44 years who represent the great- est percentage of football moderate to serious injury claims (85%) with knees (38%) and ankles (19%) being the most predominate injury sites. To address these injuries, the SportSmart model was adapted for football to provide relevance to the target group. Feedback from initial projects with NZF had highlighted the need for this speciﬁ city. In addition, the world governing body for football FIFA’s Medical and Research Committee (F-MARC) had developed a program called “The 11” which ACC were keen to see implemented."}
{"id": "614", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "Understanding the facts and belief structure While there was success with the RugbySmart concept, football required a completely different approach to build a coalition due to the following: 1. Financial considerations: Rugby has an annual budget 10–50 times that of other sports with the same playing numbers. Investing in the community aspect of the game on this scale was difﬁ cult to repeat in other sports. NZF has fewer staff and could not afford to devote the time necessary to develop and implement an injury prevention program.2. Non-governed participation: There are different forms of football that NZF does not control. ACC data collection did not distinguish between forms of football (e.g., indoor soccer, 6-a-side, 11-a-side), as it is a no-fault system. This impacted on the ability to undertake evaluations.3. Inaccurate playing numbers: NZF does not keep accurate playing numbers and relies on estimates."}
{"id": "615", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "This is a further hindrance to evaluation and also limits the development of a cost-outcome model to help secure ACC investment.4. Public perceptions. Football is considered a safer sport than rugby. It does not produce serious spinal injuries and parents have been known to remove their children from rugby in favor of football due to injury risk perception. Working toward consensus: identifying the stakeholders To encourage an increased emphasis on injury prevention and to engage NZF, ACC increased its investment in the sport. This provided for NZF to employ a person whose primary responsibility would be injury prevention, but who would also be available for other NZF duties. Having a person essentially inside NZF devoted to injury preven- tion gave this topic credibility and emphasis in the sport. This was essential in developing a coalition with NZF. The remaining ACC investment was for injury prevention resources, ensuring the injury prevention person had an established and targeted budget rather than bidding and competing for existing NZF funds."}
{"id": "616", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "While ACC was prepared to make this investment, it still took NZF 18 months to formally agree to a coalition. This was more reﬂ ective of a busy sport rather than a reluctance to be involved in injury prevention. Key discussion points included compulsory training of coaches and rule changes. NZF was not in the same posi- tion as NZRU to make injury prevention training compulsory for coaches and the sport also was concerned about the expectation to implement rule changes and the subsequent implications. The SoccerSmart program (Step 3) In 2004, NZF (formally New Zealand Soccer) and ACC adapted SportSmart to create SoccerSmart. Despite the governing bodies name change, from soccer to football, the SoccerSmart brand was retained because of its market recognition. Football coaches were identiﬁ ed as a suitable initial target and SoccerSmart was included in all existing NZF coach education courses, as well as a stand-alone workshop.

Resources were designed to be used by coaches and passed on to players. FIFA’s “The 11” resources were also included in the SoccerSmart course packs (Figure 13.4). SoccerSmart (similar to RugbySmart) focused on injuries or injury-related issues that were more prevalent in the sport of football, as determined from the ACC claims data- base. These included tackling, physical ﬁ tness, and prematch issues. Special care was also taken with the language and phrases used in SoccerSmart, to ensure suitability for the audience. Evaluation of SoccerSmart program (Step 4) As with all injury prevention ACC invests in, mod- erate to serious injury claims are used for evalua- tion. Unlike Rugby, NZF could not provide accurate playing numbers, nor an accurate estimate of the prevalence of indoor soccer. As such, moderate to serious injury claims were assessed against a fore- cast, made by ACC, as part of its cost-outcome approach (see Further reading). In 2006/2007, the return on the investment for all soccer mod- erate to serious injury claims was $2.41 (Gianotti & Hume, 2007) and there was 2.5% fewer claims against forecast for 15–44 year olds in knees and ankles."}
{"id": "618", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "This resulted in ongoing investment in the SoccerSmart program. However, the actual number of football moderate to serious injury claims is increasing, which is purported to be due to the anecdotal reports of marked growth of the game. Hence a forecast is used on the absolute number of moderate to serious injury claims. Discussion The NZ examples show a passive model that can be adapted to other sports and is effective in achieving injury prevention outcomes. In these examples, education plays more of a role than enforcement and engineering of the injury pre- vention matrix (see chapter 2) since there is no ability to enforce rules or make a sport undertake injury prevention by withholding injury cover- age. A strong coalition with the national body (NZRU, NZF) is crucial for the implementation of an effective sports injury prevention program. While investment and funding is also important, this investment would not have been as effective if the national bodies were not supportive. This is particularly important for large-scale implementa- tion of injury prevention programs. The Canadian Province of Québec model Injuries resulting from sports and recreational activ- ities are a signiﬁ cant health problem in Québec. The Canadian Community Health Survey of Statistics Canada revealed that in 2003 in Québec, inju- ries which occurred in a sport and leisure venue represented 21% of all injuries resulting in limita- tion of normal activities or medical consultation, compared with 35% of injuries at home, and 8% on the road."}

Of course, sport and recreational activity injuries are not all severe: there are more deaths on Québec roads than on sports ﬁ elds and, generally, road injuries are more severe. However, the public health burden of sport and recreational activity injuries is manifest in their morbidity. A population-based survey done for the Québec Ministry of Education, Leisure, and Sport estimates that during the year 2004, 514,000 Figure 13.4.

These data clearly show the scale of the sport and recreational activity injuries problem and the importance of establishing safe environments. In 1979, to signiﬁ cantly contribute to the estab- lishment of safe environments, the government of Québec adopted the Act Respecting Safety in Sports which created the Québec Sports Safety Board (Régnier & Goulet, 1995; Government of Québec, 1988). Since 1998, through its mission to “foster the development of recreation and sport in a safe and healthy environment and promote an active lifestyle for all Québecers,” the Safety Promotion Unit of the Québec Ministry of Education, Leisure, and Sport supervised the execution of the Act Respecting Safety in Sports. In accordance with this act, one of the Safety Promotion Unit’s orienta- tions is to “ensure that the safety and physical security and well-being of participants are pro- vided for during sports and recreation activities.”With respect to the Act, the Safety Promotion Unit is empowered to 1.

Example 4: Bodychecking injuries in minor ice hockey The injury problem (Steps 1 and 2) Ice hockey is one of Canada’s most popular winter sports, with more than 500,000 registered players in the Canadian Hockey Association. In 2004–2005, it was estimated that 9%–31% of all Canadian boys participated in organized leagues."}

This awareness sparked increased research in ice hockey which was followed, in some cases, by changes in the rules, particularly at the minor level. One of the major changes was the abolition of bodychecking for players 12 years old and under. Bodychecking is deﬁ ned as an  individual defensive tactic designed to legally sepa- rate the puck carrier from the puck by use of phy- sical contact. In 1985, to allow Midget age players (15–16 years old) who wanted to play junior hockey to ﬁ nish high school in their home towns, the Canadian Hockey Association decided to raise all age groups by 1 year, thus making the Pee Wee category 12–13 years old. With those age changes, the “no body- checking” rule was reconsidered. After a brief dis- cussion during their general meeting of 1985, the Canadian Hockey Association adopted a new rule allowing bodychecking for Pee Wee category. In the province of Québec, faced with a contro- versy on the risk of injuries associated with the new rule, Hockey Québec (the Québec Ice Hockey Federation) asked the Québec Sports Safety Board for its opinion on the matter. Understanding the facts and belief structure Realizing that no hard scientiﬁ c data were avail- able on the effect of bodychecking on the safety of Pee Wee players, the Québec Sports Safety Board sponsored an appropriate research study (Régnier et al.,1989)."}

The weight and height difference between players was shown to be one of the most important risk fac- tors of injury. Morphologic and strength differ- ences between the smallest and the largest players competing at the Pee Wee level revealed an aver- age weight and height difference of 37.2 kg and 31.5 cm, respectively. Furthermore, a 70% differ- ence in the force of impact during bodychecking between a group of small players and larger players was observed. Working toward consensus: identifying the stakeholders With those results, the next step was to convince the minor ice hockey administrators to ban body- checking at Pee Wee level. Some factors had major inﬂ uence. The involvement of a well-respected team of university researchers in the study was impor- tant, bringing credibility to the process. Moreover, the public health network of the province highly supported the actions to ban bodychecking at Pee Wee level and information campaigns in the media were launched to inﬂ uence public awareness. Finally, the Minister responsible for the administra- tion of the Act Respecting Safety in Sports was lobbied for his support of the proposal."}

Today, Québec is the only province or territory where bodycheck- ing is still banned for this age group. In the other provinces, there is still controversy about the issue. Government reports and academic studies have iden- tiﬁ ed some problems related to bodychecking and further educational initiatives have been launched. For example, the Canadian Hockey Association has been actively providing courses on the appropri- ate bodychecking techniques for coaches, players, managers, referees, trainers, and parents. Only a few training initiatives have been evaluated and the overall effectiveness of these courses on injury pre- vention has not been established. Evaluation (Step 4) It is estimated that in 20 years, this large-scale meas- ure prevented 4000 young growing players to suffer from a fracture. Moreover, there is no evidence that the ban of bodychecking at Pee Wee level reduced the level of competitiveness of Québec players at national or international levels of competition. Example 5: Full–face protection to prevent facial injuries for adult ice hockey players The injury problem (Steps 1 and 2) Even if ice hockey is one of the leading contribu- tors to sports-related injuries in Québec, it pro- vides the sport and public health communities with an impressive success story of injury preven- tion: the quasi-elimination of eye and facial inju- ries through the use of face protectors.

However, the large population of adult hockey players remained at risk because full face protection was not required beyond age 18. Understanding the facts and belief structure The effect of the use of certiﬁ ed full-face protectors by minor league players have been well docu- mented in Canada and in the United States of America. For instance, no eye injuries have been recorded for a player wearing a full-face protec- tor certiﬁ ed by the Canadian Standard Association. But the most eloquent demonstration of the effec- tiveness of full-face protectors was based on reports from Canadian ophthalmologists. In 1974–1975 the average age of hockey players suffering from an eye injury in Canada was 14 years. In 1983–1984, 5 years after full-face protectors were imposed on all minor league players by the Canadian Hockey Association, the average age of the victims rose to 24 years (Pashby, 1985). From these results, it was determined that the main population at risk of eye injury in hockey had become the thousands of adult recreational hockey players participating in organ- ized leagues not subject to the Canadian Hockey Association regulation. Many studies conducted in Québec between 1982 and 1987 conﬁ rmed these conclusions as to the vulnerability of 90,000 adult recreational play- ers not wearing full facial protection. Observations in a representative sample of arenas in Québec revealed that only 25% of these players wore facial protection in 1987 in spite of previous social mar- keting campaigns promoting the voluntary use of full-face protectors."}

It was clear that the use of full-face protectors by adult ice hockey players needed to increase by enacting regulation requiring their use. But, before the implementation of such regulation it was important to convince the players to comply with the regulation. Working toward consensus: identifying the stakeholders As was the case for the ban of bodychecking at Pee Wee level (Example 4), the regulation imposing the use of full-face protectors by adult ice hockey play- ers was supported by the public health network of the province, and by groups of ophthalmologists in Canada and in the United States of America. This support signiﬁ cantly enhanced the credibil- ity of the regulation. Social marketing campaigns promoting the use of full-face protectors were also undertaken (Figure 13.5). The Minister responsible for the administration of the Act Respecting Safety in Sports also had to be convinced. The preventive measure (Step 3) To signiﬁ cantly reduce the incidence of eyeinju- ries to adult ice hockey players, the Québec Sports Safety Board enacted a regulation imposing full- face protectors on all adult ice hockey players par- ticipating in an organized league.

One year after the adoption of the regulation, the use of full face protectors rose from 25% to 88% (it was 75% in 2005) with a cor- responding reduction in eye injuries. The relatively few eye injuries still reported involve adult players who choose not to comply with the regulation and young participants in non-organized situations. Moreover, there is no evidence that the introduc- tion of the full-face protector induced more neck injuries or aggressive behaviors from the players. An update of a previous study (Régnier et al., 1995) evaluating the economic impact of this second regulation from 1988 to 2000 showed a cost/savings ratio of 1/13.7; every dollar invested by the government in the development, promo- tion, and enforcement of the regulation generated 13.70 of savings in health care costs. Discussion From the Québec experience, what would be the answer to the question “Is legislation the answer for safety in sport?”We would certainly like to answer “no,” if for no other reason that it is not easy to constrain. In an ideal world, every stake- holder group (participants, manufacturers of equipment, owners of facilities, coaches, instruc- tors, teachers, and others) would adopt safe, or safer practices on their own. But our past experi- ence shows that this is not always the case."}

On the other hand, legislation alone is not the answer. In the Québec context, the powers deﬁ ned in the Act Respecting Safety in Sports should be viewed as only one of a number of possible intervention strategies that range from education to coercion. The injury prob- lems were approached with a multi-dimensional view, well documented facts were gathered to assess the problem, and coalitions were developed. Summary Implementing large-scale injury prevention pro- grams poses many challenges. However as the examples in this chapter have shown, they can be successful and positively impact thousands of rec- reational to elite sport participants. In summary, we revisit the ﬁ ve key elements of a large-scale injury prevention program and consider speciﬁ c lessons learned from our examples that are con- sistent with these criteria. Approach the injury problem at hand with a multidimensional view Both the New Zealand and Québec models had a cost/beneﬁ t ratios that were a speciﬁ c part of the evaluation process.

These impacts, both positive and negative, need to be identiﬁ ed before implementation and followed in the evaluation phase. All examples involved partnerships; a broad group of constituents to agree upon the issue and to have ownership in the solution.

Follow- up research documented success in the wrestling weight loss, RugbySmart and Québec eye injury examples. These publicized successes led to further initiatives, funding and application.

However, understand that successes in large-scale initiative may not match results from more controlled environments due to the inherent complexities associated with educating and evalu- ating a much larger, less-controlled population. Work toward a consensus: develop coalitions Even if you are in a position to impose mandatory safety measures, make sure you develop strong grass-roots support for your intervention and iden- tify the key stakeholders (often coaches). While the NCAA model has the capability to mandate rules, the weight management model was devel- oped with input from a broad base to achieve own- ership in the solution. In the New Zealand and Québec models, a governmental entity, national governing body, or designated position clearly responsible for the safety of sports and recreational participants with appropriate funding carried two strong messages: (1) injuries resulting from sports and recreational activities are a signiﬁ cant public health problem and (2) something can be done to prevent them from happening."}

Recognize the limits of information campaigns: develop back-up technological systems Public awareness campaigns are important, but they are not enough. Well-informed people are still human beings; which means that knowledge does not necessarily result in behavior change. To maximize effectiveness in educational efforts, injury prevention programs need to be engaging, current, and sport-speciﬁ c, using the right lan- guage (less scientiﬁ c, more plain speak) to reach the target audience. Associated resources must be stimulating and promote the enhanced perform- ance and enjoyment beneﬁ ts of programs along with injury prevention. These resources need to be designed to make it easier for the coach, refe- ree or sporting participant to take positive action, thus increasing acceptance of injury prevention. However, backup plans are important. In the wrestling example, a long-standing position state- ment did not alter people’s behavior as much as restricting the use of dehydration devices such as saunas and rubber suits.

Try to change the perception that more safety brings less fun One of the strong motivations drawing people to recreational activities, in particular to those prac- ticed outdoors such as skiing, is the sense of liberty they provide. Safety is often perceived as some- thing that will take fun away from these activities. Initiatives should promote value and fun as well as safety. For example, safety allows participation, an important selling point for coaches, players, and the national governing bodies that oversee them. Coaches, players, and referees should be alerted to injury prevention successes as soon as possible to maximize acceptance, increase participation, and further reinforce the critical role they play. Once the heavy burden of constant weight management was removed, wrestlers could spend more time on becoming better technical wrestlers.

The examples cited in this chap- ter emphasize this concept as well as the value of working from an established model or framework. We conclude this chapter with an example of a Summit on Sport Safety, organized and conducted by the province of Québec, Canada in the mid- 1990s. The resulting framework established the roadmap and the initial collaboration opportuni- ties to drive various injury prevention initiatives in the Province for the next decade. It is a model that can serve as a starting point for future initia- tives in any country. The Québec Sports Safety Board Summit on Sports Safety In order to serve as a catalyst and a unifying force to channel and co-ordinate interventions from dis- parate groups, each holding part of the solution to this problem, the Québec Sports Safety Board sponsored the ﬁ rst summit on sport and recreation safety.

The following stages leading to the summit were.1. Consultation meetings: Close to 100 experts and representatives of organizations participated in ﬁ ve meetings."}

It was clear that participants wanted an “action” oriented event rather than an abstract process.2. Sports safety survey: In order to complete the consultation meetings, a questionnaire was posted to 7000 contributors from diverse sectors of intervention. Among other topics, the participants had to give their opinion on priorities for action over the years to come.3. The program: From the consultation activities, the summit’s management committee selected 13 areas of intervention resulting in the creation of 13 working groups.4. Participant preparation: Each working group held at least one meeting before the summit. The aim of these meetings was to begin developing goals with a view to the actions required to reach those goals."}

One hundred and ten speciﬁ c actions were identiﬁ ed, ranging from regulation modiﬁ cations to social marketing campaigns. Most of the participat- ing agencies committed themselves to carry out the actions falling within their responsibility. A ﬂ exible, easy to use follow-up system has been established to track progress and maintain the momentum of each group toward honoring their commitment. Beyond the action plans, the most important outcome of the summit was the consolidation of a real network of organizations coming from dif- ferent ﬁ elds and the public and private sectors. For the ﬁ rst time these stakeholders were exchanging information and expertise on the common prob- lem of safety in sport and recreational activities in Québec. In 1990, Québec was the province with the low- est rate of sport and recreational injuries in Canada: 67/1000 participants compared with 100/1000 for the rest of the country. In 2003, Québec was still the province with the lowest rate of sport and rec- reational injuries in Canada."}

A major event may involve only two teams com- peting in front of 17,000 spectators for less than 2 h on a single day but the variation is inﬁ nite. When planning a major event it is customary to appoint a Chief Medical Adviser for the event and it is essential that this individual is familiar with the hazards and risks involved in such an under- taking. In many instances this will be the same individual, or team of professionals, and it should be a priority that medical staff with experience of all the particular challenges are recruited to advise and cover the event. This is especially so in high- risk sports where medical staff unfamiliar with the sport may well ﬁ nd that they are ignorant of the environment and equipment in use (motor sport, equestrian sports, water sport, winter sports). Depending on how far in advance the Chief Medical Adviser is appointed, there should be opportunities to implement emergency and injury prevention strategies and to introduce effective risk management procedures. However, these opportu- nities might not allow for the implementation of the standard injury prevention strategies outlined in previous chapters because these are primarily aimed at sports governing bodies, coaches, equip- ment manufacturers, and athletes themselves. For example, all major events involving profes- sional football (soccer) and American Football take place in purpose built stadia. Teams travel with their own medical support staff and there is no possibility of an event Chief Medical Adviser having any impact on the quality of the pitch, the protective equipment worn by athletes, the train- ing technique of players, the falling technique of players, or the rules of the sport. The medical staff providing support at these events will normally have done so on numerous previous occasions and the opportunity to implement injury prevention strategies at this stage is non-existent."}

The largest daily crowds are seen at the New York Marathon (2.5 million spectators) and the London Marathon (500,000) and the other major events in this category include the Tour de France cycling (434,000/day), Sydney 2000 Olympics (418,000/ day), NASCAR (186,100/day), Kentucky Derby horse racing (156,400/day), Melbourne Cup horse racing (106,500/day), and Salt Lake 2002 Winter Games (95,300/day). By comparison, the US professional sports attracted a large number of spectators over the whole season but only modest numbers attended the individual events. The ﬁ gures for 2006 are as follows: Major League Baseball—94.9 million spectators over 2419 games (30,970/event) College Football—32.6 million spectators over 709 games (46,039/event) NBA Basketball—21.6 million spectators over 1230 games (17,558/event) NHL Ice hockey—20.8 million spectators over 1230 games (16,955/event) The other sports that attract over 10 million spec- tators include NPB baseball (Japan—19.9 million), NFL football (USA—17.3 million), Premier League soccer (GB—12.8 million), Bundersliga 1 soccer (Germany—12.5 million), La Liga soccer (Spain— 11.0 million), and the Tour de France cycling (10 million). The sports attracting 1–9 million specta- tors are national soccer leagues (Italy, France, Japan), the multi-sport, multi-national events (Olympic and Paralympic Games), NASCAR, and the Rugby Union World Cup. The largest number of participants Marathons and the multi-sport, multi-national events dominate this group—London marathon (35,500 participants), New York marathon (17,000), Sydney marathon (13,000), Sydney 2000 Olympics (10,651—16 days), US College football (6,095—709 games), Melbourne Commonwealth Games 2006 (4,500—11 days), Athens Paralympic Games 2004 (3,969—12 days), Salt Lake 2002 Winter Games (2,399—16 days), and NFL American football (1,692—256 games). Factors to consider The recommendations that follow are the result of a detailed review of selected major interna- tional and national sporting events that occur around the world. This “basket” of over 40 events involved 102,432 amateur and professional com- petitors taking part in 9,313 days of competition watched on site by over 292 million spectators (this does not include the TV audiences). Given the vast variety of these events, the ﬁ rst duty of all medical staff at any sport event is to retrieve and analyze the following basic information: • Number of sports—single or multiple • Number of participants—individuals and/or teams • Number of support staff—coaches, physical therapists, medics, sports scientists • Number of spectators and VIPs • Number of countries involved—national only, international • Number of venues—single or multiple • Accessibility of venues—static stadium, mobile, global • Frequency of event—once only, repeated annu- ally, monthly, weekly • Number of days medical cover is required (including training and preparation days)—1 day only, weeks, months • Special needs of the athletes—wheelchair event, blind competitors • Special challenges of the sport—high speed, motor vehicles, horses, water, ice, snow • Medical services traveling with the individuals or teams—team doctors, physical trainers to national squads • Medical cover at locations other than the com- petition venue—hotels, athletes’ village, train- ing areas, on-call cover • Need for speciﬁ c medical subspecialties • Governing body requirements for medical cover at events • National legislation or guidelines in force regarding the medical cover at major events • National legislation guidelines in force regard- ing temporary licenses of accompanying physicians"}

This chapter provides an opportunity to explore some of the “best practice” issues for medical staff who have never had the opportunity to supervise or regulate an event of this size and complexity. Although many of the topics under consideration will not be seen as strictly “injury prevention meas- ures,” the underlining principle is that managing any injury in an effective and rapid fashion may well prevent further damage to the individual con- cerned. This will in turn lead to a reduction in the rehabilitation time and can be considered as part of the injury prevention—injury mitigation spectrum. It is generally accepted that, following a spi- nal cord injury, 50% of the resulting disability is caused by the inept handling of the injured per- son (lack of immobilization strategy, spinal board, etc.). It can therefore be seen that having the appropriate equipment and trained personnel can signiﬁ cantly impact the outcome of injury and this could reasonably be included in a review of injury prevention. In addition, anything that increases the anxiety or stress levels in an athlete may well lead to a decrease in performance and event planning should be aimed at eliminating any concerns that relate to medical issues. It is not only the competitors who are at risk in this context but also avoidable fatalities can occur amongst spectators at big sporting events. At the Winter Games in Lillehammer (Norway 1994) over 20,000 people were camped out in tents along the route of the 50 km cross-country track (overnight temperatures of –30ºC). One spectator, having left the tent to ﬁ nd the communal washroom in the middle of the night, was apparently unable to ﬁ nd his way back to his tent and was discovered dead in the snow the following morning (Ekeland, 1995)."}
{"id": "649", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "At the Horseracing Derby (Great Britain 1995) a spec- tator who had arrived in a coach felt unwell dur- ing the afternoon and returned to the coach to rest. The coach was locked, and the sun was very hot, so he sheltered under the coach and fell asleep. The coach driver returned at the end of the afternoon and reversed the vehicle out of its parking place to prepare for departure. In the process, he ran over and killed the sleeping spectator. In both instances, the consumption of alcohol was thought to have played a signiﬁ cant part in the tragic outcome. Further, some events representing special chal- lenges are explicitly addressed and the speciﬁ c points to be considered are outlined. Major event planning tools Basic planning For basic planning purposes, the checklist shown in Table 14.1 provides a summary of all the pre-, during and post-event requirements. Venue medical cover Venue cover is relatively simple, as long as the venue is not spread out too much (Tour de France) and the event is not too large (Olympics). Cover for the participants is often provided by the teams themselves (team doctor and/or physical therapist) but facilities will need to be provided for them to treat the team members throughout the day (see checklist in Table 14.2): • Squad treatment room at the competition venue • Squad treatment room at the training area • Squad treatment room at the accommodation area These treatment rooms may be communal areas in events involving multiple sports (track and ﬁ eld). Competition venues need additional attention because of the large number of spectators (and VIPs) who are in attendance (see checklist in Table 14.3)."}

Medical indemnity and international competition Medical staff traveling abroad provides a particular challenge for organizers because of the medical–legal issues surrounding their national qualiﬁ cations. Within the European Union, medical staff are free to practice in an unrestricted fashion but this does not apply when traveling to North America or Australia. Doctors and therapists may not be insured to prac- tice abroad and will certainly not be entitled to obtain medicine on prescription in a foreign coun- try. The organizers need to communicate the need for a temporary licensing procedure to all visiting physicians in advance. The organizers must therefore make arrangements for visiting medical staff to have access to: • A pharmacy (or access to a doctor employed by the organizing committee to write the necessary prescriptions) • A pathology laboratory—blood testing, swabs, urinalysis • X-ray and imaging facilities • Specialist opinion • Dental care • Ophthalmology, facio-maxillary surgery, ortho- pedic surgery, etc. One way of ensuring that this runs smoothly is to appoint locally established doctors who can serve as mediators for the visiting medical staff and facilitate access to all services. Medical cover for the spectators This often poses the biggest challenge to the organizers and their Chief Medical Adviser. In many cases, nation law is in place that mandates the minimum standards of medical cover at large events and individual venues may have safety certiﬁ cates that control capacity and the support services required on site. Table 14.5 provides a checklist covering spectator issues."}
{"id": "655", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "At any venue where large numbers of peo- ple congregate, the opportunity for the medical resources to be totally overwhelmed by a major incident must be addressed. In an era where terror- ist activities occur on an annual basis, we also have instances where accidental explosions (cooking gas) or stand collapse have occurred at sporting events. These events require close co-operation between all the emergency services (police, ﬁ re service, and ambulance service) and the medical team on site. Indeed the emergency services may not be deployed on site for 30 min or more (particularly in rural locations) and the only medical support available will be the event team. Major Incident Medical Management and Support requires particular training and all medi- cal staff providing cover at a big event should ensure that they have completed an appropriate training course. In the United Kingdom, the stand- ard course takes place over 4 days. As a result of a number of high-proﬁ le disasters at football events in the United Kingdom, the Health and Safety Executive published the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (ISBN 978 0 11 702074 0) which covers all aspects of spectator cover (Figure 14.1). These guidelines indicate the minimum level of medical cover expected for sporting events and a summary is included in Table 14.6 to help those practitioners who have no national guidelines to follow. Very Important People Organizers should be aware that although a few VIPs are actually former world class athletes, the vast majority are not in perfect physical shape.

This cannot be achieved at the last minute. Table 14.7 provides a checklist for VIP medical coverage. Selection and training of medical staff: the multi-disciplined approach Medical support at a major event will not be restricted to doctors and physical therapists alone and consideration should be given at an early stage to the mix of staff required for any particular event or venue.

Table 14.8 provides an overview of fac- tors to be considered related to selection and train- ing of medical staff. Events requiring special attention High-risk events (including those taking place at extremes of climate or high altitude) A number of events involve additional risk to the competitors because of the nature of the event or the location in which it takes place. These events provide a much greater challenge to medical sup- port staff and include the outdoor winter sports and water sports, equestrian sports, and high speed sports (motor racing and motor cycle racing). These are invariably associated with a much higher incidence of signiﬁ cant injury and fatality. Medical support staff at these events must be familiar with the sport concerned, the environ- ment in which it takes place and the type of injury that can be expected. These events require all the basic cover outlined earlier but additional consid- eration will need to be given (see Table 14.9). Disability sport and spectators in wheelchairs Medical support for disability sport is essentially identical to that already outlined apart from the fol- lowing areas—support staff, transport, and access. However, the support staff/athlete ratio is nor- mally higher for events involving disabled players. Suitable accommodation and transport needs to be available for these individuals to avoid additional stress for the athletes concerned."}

Marathon The two sporting events with the largest number of competitors in this analysis are both marathons and they provide an excellent model for exploring injury prevention strategies. The London Marathon has been run continuously since 1981. Of the 131,000 applicants in the London Marathon only 48,000 (36.6%) are accepted as par- ticipants.

Of these, 35,557 will actually start the race (74.1% of the accepted appli- cation) but over 99% of these will now expect to ﬁ n- ish the race. This ﬁ gure has climbed from 88.7% in 1981 as a direct result of the management strategies Figure 14.1. Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (2008)"}

Health questionnaire and medical clearance All applicants are required to complete a health questionnaire and to provide a statement from their own medical practitioner that they are “ﬁ t to run.”The Chief Medical Adviser of the event must be prepared to monitor and manage the infor- mation provided on the health questionnaires to assist in providing the necessary medical sup- port for participants. It should also be noted that because marathons are now used as fund raising opportunities by many charities, the majority of the participants will have no special sporting skills and a signiﬁ cant number may be disabled. Education Once accepted, each competitor should be provided with a detailed education leaﬂ et outlining a simple training program and providing advice about nutri- tion, ﬂ uid intake, sleep, and rest. Climate This should include a review of the different strate- gies that might be needed under different climatic conditions. In London, experience has shown Table 14.6 Minimum level of medical cover at sport events.

Humidity has ranged 28–96% and this will have an effect on clothing and ﬂ uid intake. The media Education can be greatly enhanced by utilizing media programs (particularly TV) to follow groups of novice runners as they prepare for the event. This has proven particularly effective in Australia and in Great Britain; children’s TV programs are regularly used to educate children taking part in mini-marathon and “fun run” events. Venue preparation A typical marathon will have water stations every 1.6 km (from the 4.8 km mark) with access to sports drinks every 8 km (starting at the 8 km mark). Special drinking stations are also set up for the elite runner group where they can place their own prepared drinks—a total of eight along the 42.2 km course (approximately every 5 km). Adequate barriers will be erected to separate the competitors from the spectators and regulatory arrangements need to be coordinated with event marshals and police. In London 2006, there were 1100 marshals at the start, 3050 along the route, and 2500 at the ﬁ nish—a total of 6650. Portable toilets need to be available for competitors at the start, along the course and at the ﬁ nish (total of 950 in London 2006 race)."}

Training and Major Incident Medical Management and Support All medical staff must be appropriately trained and qualiﬁ ed to undertake the duties they have been allocated. In events that include large crowds, this may include additional training in major incident management. Security and accreditation All medical staff must be able to move freely from venue to venue and from area to area (spectators, athletes, training, etc.)within each venue. Careful consideration needs to be given to the levels of accreditation needed under these circumstances. The unexpected event It is clearly not possible to predict the unpredict- able but the need for ﬂ exibility and having a con- tingency strategy for sudden unforeseen problems is essential in the preparation for any major event. History has a habit of repeating itself and the need to review similar sporting events that have taken place in the past, to plan for the unexpected, and to pay meticulous attention to detail cannot be emphasized enough.

Organization of a race that takes place over 10,000 km in some of the most inhospitable terrain on the globe is a sig- niﬁ cant challenge. Competitors have been assaulted by members of the public (Monica Seles). Assaults involving spectators are more frequent in soccer and rugby when the national team wins and the number of assaults increases as the crowd gets larger, irrespective of the location of the game (home or away) (Sivarajasingam et al.,2005). Alcohol is frequently associated with disturbances amongst spectators and some events ban the sale or consumption of alcohol on site. Well-documented sporting disasters have involved stands collaps- ing, stampedes, spectators being crushed, ﬁ res, and locked exits. Events taking place in remote loca- tions can easily overwhelm the local emergency infrastructure, including the local district hospital which may have very limited specialist cover and no neurosurgical or burns unit on site. Sub-zero temperatures result in ice formation and spectators will be at considerable risk when walking on this surface. At the ski jumping at Lillehammer 1994 Olympics, ﬁ ne sand was used to prepare the paths used by spectators but this was rapidly incorporated in a layer of ice as the day progressed."}
{"id": "670", "title": "Sport_injury_prevent_2009", "text_chunked": "This resulted in a large number of spectators falling and suffering fractures when returning to the village after the event. Coarse gravel was used on subsequent days and the inci- dence of fractures plummeted. Post-event activities Following any major event, an audit should be undertaken to review the positive and negative expe- riences and make recommendations about future events of this sort. These results should be published whenever possible to enable other organizers to share your experiences (Budgett et al.,1997; Junge et al.,2004; Junge et al.,2006; Dvorak et al.,2007). In certain circumstances these may form the basis of guidelines for the organization of major sporting events (Guide for Managing risk in Motor Sport, 2007). Conclusion The challenges presented in planning a major event are virtually unlimited."}

{"id": "693", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Preface The concept for this book is based on the expanding ﬁeld of sports rehabilitation and injury prevention. Evidence of this expansion includes an increasing amount of research and publications related to sports rehabilitation and allied ﬁelds of practice such as sports therapy, athletic training and sports physio- therapy. Despite the number and volume of publications in sports rehabilitation, there appears to be limited resources that accurately and effectively account for evidence-based practices. Whilst some resources ex- pand evidence-based practice knowledge, there is a need to develop a complete resource that fully explains and articulates these important principles. This current text has used an evidence-based practice approach to fully acknowledge the many diverse ar- eas, applications and management strategies that are often unique to sports rehabilitation, but distinctly different from similar ﬁelds of practice and study. Few sports rehabilitation programmes currently provide students with the breadth of information and practical application required for professional prac- tice. This text has attempted to bridge the knowledge and practice gap, by considering the functional de- velopment of the sports rehabilitator’s knowledge and practice requirements for professional compe- tency. The text provides an up-to-date look at dif- ferent evidence-based practice protocols and initial assessment strategies for the screening of injury and pathological conditions. The ﬁrst few chapters introduce the scope of prac- tice for sports rehabilitation, and then describe, ex- plain and evaluate the initial assessment and screen- ing procedures necessary for decision making and clinical practice. These chapters further provide analysis on musculoskeletal function and dysfunc- tion in relation to systemic organisation."}

These include, amongst oth- ers, nutritional analysis, psychological considera- tions in injury management and prevention, clinical reasoning development, and strength and condition- ing principles. The book concludes with a range of chapters devoted to different injury conditions and body regions. These chapters detail the more com- mon injuries and pathologies and argue for best man- agement strategies based on research and applied evidence. Each chapter also contains several practical ap- plication boxes that provide additional information summarising unique chapter-speciﬁc information. The majority of chapters contain applied examples and case studies to illustrate the processes and deci- sions necessary for clinical action and management. Each case study has been carefully developed to fa- cilitate group discussion in the classroom, or for the clinician to consider as part of continued profes- sional development. In addition to serving as an upper level undergrad- uate or graduate textbook for students or clinicians in practice, the book is an excellent resource guide, ﬁlled with useful information and evidence-based practice considerations and applications. You will want to have this textbook on your desk or book- shelf. The features of consistent organisation, case studies, discussion questions, up-to-date references, research evidence and practical application boxes are designed to provide information required for effec- tive study as well as directing clinical practice."}

Before one commences the building process, there is a carefully constructed visual or di- agrammatic plan to navigate the process; so too does this planning apply to the design and shaping of this text. In the building process, consideration is given to the foundation, in terms of its shape, depth, form, and length. This text has a number of foundation chap- ters that secure the content for future development of the other chapters. The main foundation knowl- edge is the understanding of anatomical application, and using this knowledge to guide assessment. This anatomical foundation knowledge informs the deci- sions necessary for clinical action in terms of injury management. Whilst bricks are important in terms of informing the structure of a building, it is the cement that ensures that each brick is secured and articulates with other bricks and structures. In this text, the ce- ment is represented by underpinning themes, such as clinical reasoning skills and abilities, that traverse the chapters and ensures that each chapter although perceptively different, is able to articulate with other chapters and develop this consortium of knowledge. After completion, houses take on a new shape and design, one which may have transformed the orig- inal landscape; however there is always room for change, improvement or reﬁnement. This text, in its ﬁnal form, has orchestrated the journey of clinical practice from consideration of the scope of practice, through to the essential skills necessary for decision making, and concluding with a consideration of how to manage a range of injuries and pathologies."}

Each chapter begins with an introductory paragraph (see below) that identiﬁes and outlines the aims and outcomes for that chapter. The chapter aims and objectives will be emphasised at the beginning. Use these to confirm your understanding of the chapter content. This chapter provides an overview, analysis, and application of clinical reasoning and problem solving skills in the development of professional competencies within the health care profession generally and more speciﬁcally sports rehabilitation. The chapter is important as it will help you develop your thinking skills as you progress your reading throughout the book. By the end of this chapter the reader will be able to locate and explain the role and efﬁcacy of clinical reasoning skills within a professional practice domain. This will inform an appreciation for the complex nature of knowledge construction in relation to clinical explanation and judgement. By considering clinical reasoning as a functional skill set, the reader will further be in a position to explain different models of reasoning and ask structured questions in an attempt to better formulate and construct answers to clinical questions, issues, and decisions. The chapter will further encourage the reader to use problem solving and clinical reasoning skills to justify substantially, through research evidence, professional practice actions and outcomes."}

Russell University of California–Irvine, USA Introduction and aims The popularity of physical activity in all of its forms continues to steadily increase. More than just the do- main of elite or professional athletes, the populace enjoys a variety of recreational pursuits from hiking and running to skiing and surﬁng, from badminton and tennis to cricket and hockey. In such endeav- ours many participants ﬁnd that injury is inevitable. Unfortunate circumstances are not conﬁned to those engaging in rugby or “X games”, daredevil sports like Parkour, kitesurﬁng or acrobatic bicycle jump- ing, although clearly these carry a high cost in physi- cal trauma (Young 2002; Spanjersberg and Schipper 2007; Miller and Demoiny 2008). Young footballers and senior golfers alike are prone to injury, as are Olympic performers and “weekend warriors” be- cause injury does not discriminate (Delaney et al.2009; Falvey et al.2009). Likewise, non-traditional athletes such as dancers (Fitt 1996; Stretanski 2002; Koutedakis and Jamurtas 2004) will not escape in- jury (Bowling 1989; Garrick and Lewis 2001; Bron- ner, Ojofeitimi and Spriggs 2003; Laws 2005). Whether they are pursuing gold medals or leisure, those who participate in physical activity require both proper preventive training and proper health- care; they will beneﬁt greatly from experts who can deliver these. Sport rehabilitators and other allied health professionals have much to offer physically active people."}

The role of the sport rehabilitator Preparing an individual to successfully participate in sport requires, by its very nature, expertise from multiple specialities. Managing the injuries that occur to sport participants also requires input from many specialists. Thus, at any given point the athlete may be surrounded by a team of professionals, including the coach, club manager, conditioning specialist, biomechanist, physiotherapist, nutrition- ist, exercise physiologist, chiropodist, chiropractor, Sports Rehabilitation and Injury Prevention Edited by Paul Comfort and Earle Abrahamson C⃝2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd"}

A brief introduction to a similar type of sport healthcare provider in the United States of Amer- ica is useful here as a comparison. Certiﬁed Ath- letic Trainers (denoted by the qualiﬁcation “ATC”) are “health care professionals who collaborate with physicians to optimize activity and participation of patients and clients. Athletic training encom- passes the prevention, diagnosis, and intervention of emergency, acute, and chronic medical condi- tions involving impairment, functional limitations, and disabilities” (National Athletic Trainers’ Asso- ciation 2009b). The National Athletic Trainers’ As- sociation, the professional body of Certiﬁed Ath- letic Trainers, has existed since 1950. Standards of practice are set and a certiﬁcation examina- tion is administered by the Board of Certiﬁcation (2009) to ensure that the profession is properly regulated.

As with Graduate Sport Reha- bilitators, accountability to such standards is imper- ative for sustaining the integrity of the profession. Continuing professional development There is no place pitchside for healthcare practi- tioners who cannot perform the required duties that arise under the pressure of managing injury during sporting competition. Therefore, a fundamental re- sponsibility of the sport rehabilitator – or any other healthcare practitioner – is to secure a high stan- dard in their education. Certainly this encompasses the undergraduate and postgraduate courses and the motivation to embrace diligence and excellence in all required modules, work placements, internships and the like. The knowledge required and tasks allowed for speciﬁc professional qualiﬁcations are usually dictated by professional organisations. As mentioned above, BASRaT hold sport rehabilitators to a high standard of education."}
{"id": "722", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Once a qualiﬁcation is at- tained, however, another educational process ensues: professionals must engage in continuing profes- sional development (CPD). The importance of this cannot be overstated. CPD helps the sport rehabili- tator not only maintain their skills, but acquire new ones that broaden one’s ability to offer high quality healthcare to athletes, clients and patients. More- over, knowledge in sport science and sport medicine is constantly evolving as further basic and applied re- search is undertaken. Adequate CPD helps the sport rehabilitator stay abreast of these developments. CPD courses afford exciting opportunities for per- sonal enrichment. Many topics are germane to the ﬁeld and a veritable subculture exists to provide ad- equate chances for professionals to enlist in train- ing courses that match every ability, need and de- sire. Most professional societies, including BASRaT, advise their members about suitable courses and the required quantity of CPD hours. Advanced life support, manual therapy, pitchside emergency care, strength training, exercise testing, specialised joint examinations, rehabilitative exercise and manage- ment of non-orthopaedic injuries and conditions are only a few topics representative of the wide gamut of offerings. A qualiﬁcation in basic cardiopulmonary resus- citation for healthcare providers (i.e. BLS/AED – Basic Life Support/Automated External Deﬁbrilla- tion) is considered a minimal credential that should be kept up to date by periodic skills retraining."}

{"id": "724", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 7 characteristics that all sport rehabilitators must strive for as they provide care to the public. Knowledge is the learning and understanding of facts that form the basis for practice. It provides the information on which a successful career is built. Ability is the application of knowledge. Thus, knowledge really is not useful until a person accomplishes a task by applying it. Wisdom, though, is like the glue that holds a pro- fessional career together. It is the most difﬁcult – but also the most signiﬁcant – of the three to garner because it is gained over time as one matures and is exposed to an ever-widening variety of experiences. Wisdom considers both the available knowledge and ability, mixing them in the right proportion to elicit the best result within a given set of present circum- stances. Whilst this may seem somewhat esoteric, the three characteristics are fundamental to success and all healthcare professionals draw on each of them everyday. Ethical considerations Ethics refers to a set of concepts, principles and laws that inform people’s moral obligation to behave with decency."}
{"id": "725", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Part of this is the necessity to protect peo- ple who are in a relatively vulnerable position, such as a patient or client in a healthcare setting. Similar to other professionals, each sport rehabilitator must consider themselves a healthcare practitioner and, therefore, under an ethical obligation for inscrutable professional conduct. Sport medicine presents chal- lenging parameters within which to apply an ethical framework (Dunn et al.2007; Salkeld 2008), due largely to the high public visibility of sport itself. This is perhaps an even more signiﬁcant reason for the sport rehabilitator to ardently ensure that their practice falls under appropriate accountability. Unfortunately ethical dilemmas do not always lend themselves to clear, objective dispensation; thus, governing bodies codify guiding principles for conduct. The Code of Ethics of the British Associ- ation of Sport Rehabilitators and Trainers, shown in Table 1.3, is an example of guidelines that promote proper behaviour. In healthcare the ﬁeld of ethics sets appropriate and acceptable standards to protect the public from damages incurred at the hands of unscrupulous or incompetent practitioners and the deleterious effects of unwarranted or dangerous diagnostic or therapeu- tic interventions. Respect for the dignity of humans is placed foremost and healthcare practice must ac- commodate to this high standard. There are a number of circumstances that occur in sport that can strain the typical application of ethics; areas where difﬁ- culties arise include: r decisions about return to sport activity with a per- sisting injury r pharmaceutical therapies to assist participation r participation of children, especially in high-risk sport r sharing of conﬁdential athlete medical informa- tion amongst practitioners, or between practition- ers and public representatives, such as the press r ergogenic aids, such as anabolic steroids and blood “doping.”"}
{"id": "726", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Of these, treating an athlete’s medical informa- tion with conﬁdentiality is likely to be the most dif- ﬁcult and frequently compromised, particularly in the pitchside environment (Salkeld 2008). Salkeld suggests that several competing challenges and pres- sures collide pitchside to create ethical dilemmas: the close proximity of an injured player to other play- ers and coaches when being examined, the public visibility of an injury, the interests of the sporting club and the desire of the coaching staff to receive information about the injury coupled with the con- comitant desire of the player to shield this infor- mation from the coaches. Additional areas of con- temporary ethical challenges for practitioners caring for athletes include informed consent for care, drug prescription and use of innovative or emerging tech- nologies (Dunn et al.2007). The most appropriate way for the sport rehabili- tator to manage potentially difﬁcult ethical predica- ments is to practise diligently under an approved ethical code, such as that of the British Associa- tion for Sport Rehabilitators and Trainers, and to de- cide how individual ethical quandaries will be han- dled prior to being confronted by them. The conse- quences of infractions are severe and have resulted in revoked professional licences, registrations and certiﬁcations, and have ended careers in particularly egregious cases."}

Sport rehabilitators and other practitioners of sport injury care are subject to lawsuits brought by athletes and their representa- tives (e.g. parents, carers). As previously mentioned, consistently following an appropriate code of ethics and continually educating yourself via CPD are two ways to ameliorate the risk. It is also crucial that sport injury professionals maintain malpractice and liability insurance cover, a caveat for which BASRaT ensures compliance of its member Graduate Sport Rehabilitators. The discussion of legal liability ﬁrst needs a direc- tive citing the proper way of acting that is acknowl- edged by courts when deriving judgments. “The man on the Clapham omnibus” is a common phrase in English law that denotes a person who acts truly and fairly (Glynn and Murphy 1996) with all facul- ties that would be expected under the circumstances. (An American equivalent is “a reasonable and pru- dent person.”)A structure of accountability is funda- mental to application of this concept. Within a given context it may be modiﬁed appropriately; healthcare is only one realm to which it pertains (Glynn and Murphy 1996). Whilst being afraid of the poten- tial for litigation in a sport healthcare environment would unnecessarily constrain a well-qualiﬁed pro- fessional, undeniably sport rehabilitators and other healthcare practitioners must be cognisant of the in- herent risk of being sued for wrong actions (acts of commission) or for inaction when action is war- ranted (acts of omission)."}
{"id": "729", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Instead of being intimi- dated, one should take all necessary steps to reduce the likelihood of a lawsuit as much as possible. The tenet of a “public right to expertise” was pro- posed for the sport and physical education ﬁelds more than 25 years ago (Baker 1980, 1981). The general concept states that members of the public have the right to expect that those who offer them- selves as professionals in a given ﬁeld of endeav- our are qualiﬁed as experts in that ﬁeld. In the con- text of sport rehabilitation, affording the public this right is paramount because of the potential for se- vere consequences when healthcare providers are inadequately skilled or make errors in practice or judgement (Goodman 2001). Countless legal cases transcend recent decades (Appenzeller 2005) as plaintiffs (people ﬁling a law- suit) persist in claiming negligence by defendants (people being sued) such as healthcare providers, coaches and institutions. Generally a negligence claim must show the following (Champion 2005): r there is a veriﬁable standard of care to which the defendant should be held r the defendant had a duty to care for the plaintiff r the defendant breached their duty r the plaintiff sustained damages or injury r the damages or injury were caused by the defen- dant’s breach of the duty. Risk of exposure to legal liability related to health- care in sport usually occurs in four main areas, the ﬁrst three of which are related to one another (Kane and White 2009): 1. Pre-participation physical examination – A screening process to evaluate the athlete’s phys- ical and mental status prior to engaging in sport should be a fundamental requirement before such engagement occurs.2. Determination of an athlete’s ability to participate – Whether confronted with signs and symptoms pitchside, courtside, in a ﬁrst aid facil- ity, in a polyclinic, or elsewhere, proper decision making about an athlete’s ﬁtness to participate must be made in accordance with current health- care practice."}
{"id": "730", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "3. Evaluation and care of signiﬁcant injuries on the pitch or court – Healthcare professionals not only must be well-qualiﬁed, they must deliver care that is appropriate for a given situation. Concussions, spinal cord injuries and hyperthermia are three examples of injuries requiring urgent, specialised diagnostic and treatment procedures. A sponsor- ing club, university, school or organisation must ensure that a plan is in place to adequately respond to emergency situations that may arise in sport."}

Disclosure of personal medical record informa- tion – Conﬁdentiality is a fundamental right and expectation of all patients and clients, including athletes. The sport rehabilitator must take care to not convey – even unwittingly – information about an athlete’s case to others without the ath- lete’s permission. Additional concerns for the sport rehabilitator that relate to potential injury circumstances in these general categories are accumulated in Table 1.4 (Anderson 2002; Champion 2005; Kane and White 2009). Following a review of pertinent legal cases, Good- man (2001) corroborated that those who supervise teams could be liable if they or their sport healthcare providers failed to perform properly in any of these speciﬁc areas: r Provide appropriate training instruction.r Maintain or purchase safe equipment.r Hire or supervise competent and responsible per- sonnel.r Give adequate warning to participants concerning dangers inherent in a sport.r Provide prompt and proper medical care."}

Making decisions based on experience and in- stincts rather than seeking appropriate authorita- tive advice 5. Not educating a patient/athlete about a therapeutic modality intervention 6. Underestimating the amount of documentation re- quired with catastrophic injury events In short, sadly there are virtually no limits to what one can be sued for with respect to managing sport injury. This should be so sobering that the prudent sport rehabilitator will prepare accordingly to reduce as much as possible the likelihood of this occurring. Conclusion The sport rehabilitator is a key member of the sport injury management team. As such, you must adhere to several important professional, practical, ethical and legal principles. Properly equipping yourself to administer acute injury management in the venues where practice will be undertaken – whether pitch- side, courtside, trackside, in a clinic or elsewhere – is vitally important. However, simply being prepared to deliver care required by sport participants does not sufﬁciently qualify a sport rehabilitator, or any other sport health professional for that matter. Proper eth- ical and legal frameworks are integral to success, as well."}

This chapter will allow the reader to gain an understanding of musculoskeletal screening and its role in injury prevention, identify the musculoskele- tal screening methods available including a discus- sion of the validity and reliability of screening meth- ods. The chapter will ﬁnally recommend a screening procedure for injury risk identiﬁcation. With the need for athletes to play an ever- increasing number of ﬁxtures, the enforced breaks due to injury need to be decreased. Several ap- proaches can be taken to ensure that the athlete is trained and prepared so that any possible problems are either dealt with before they arise or measures are in place so that treatment can be administered rapidly upon injury. Injury prevention is a process whereby the athlete is screened through a variety of tests to identify any potential problems with their musculoskeletal composition. These problems can then be identiﬁed and training practices put in place to either eradicate these problems or reduce their possible impact. Several procedures are used by sports practitioners with varying degrees of success as the need for one common procedure for musculoskeletal screening becomes apparent. Several researchers have attempted to identify which methods offer the highest degree of accuracy and validity (Gabbe et al.2004; Miller and Callister 2009; McClean et al."}
{"id": "744", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2005). Pre-habilitation can often be overlooked in the makeup of a sports support team, which can often lead to problems being overlooked and the team or individual not performing to their potential through- out their season due to injury. In contrast some professional clubs spend too much time on reme- dial level pre-habilitation and not enough time on high intensity training that meets the demands of the sport. Procedures need to be implemented to en- sure the amount of training days and competitive sessions missed are minimised. Practitioners need to be proactive with their treatments plans and not rely on the traditional reactive plans. In order for this to be the case practitioners need to be fully aware of the latest research and methods in the area of need through continued professional development. These plans often commence during the offseason or the early part of pre-season. During this period the athlete can be assessed without the demands of competition, which will enable the practitioner to gain the knowledge needed to plan for the upcoming season. Screening can be completed through a variety of tests including physical activity tests, functional as- sessment and questionnaires. These all have varying strengths and weaknesses and are also dependent on the practitioner who is carrying out the screening."}

The ﬁndings of the athlete screening can be assessed for risk of injury so that plans can be made to reduce the level of risk for the athlete. Screening methods The approach taken by the leisure industry as a whole towards injury prevention is one that involved a health screening questionnaire. The questionnaire can often be modiﬁed to include a few general musculoskeletal questions which, if answered nega- tively, can then result in the athlete being referred to their GP. The method of screening which in- cludes this GP referral approach is very general and mainly focuses on reduced liability of the adminis- tering facility or practitioner. Although this approach would not be recommended when working with ath- letes in sport rehabilitation, the use of a question- naire is often overlooked, even though research has shown it to be a useful screening tool. Research by Dawson et al. (2009) suggests that through the use of the Extended Nordic Musculoskeletal Question- naire (NMQ-E) (see Figure 2.1) potential pain areas and consequential problems can be identiﬁed. The questionnaire needs to be administered by a suitable practitioner and not the athlete involved, ensuring the results are valid. Research suggested that in conjunc- tion with relevant functional assessments this ques- tionnaire was a useful starting point in the screening process."}
{"id": "747", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The results found that prevalence of mus- culoskeletal problems could be correctly diagnosed and treated effectively. The reliability of the ques- tionnaire used was tested over a series of trials with the same results shown, indicating the validity and repeatability (Dawson et al.2009). Figure 2.1 clearly shows the important areas of the body so the athlete knows which part the questions are related to and then follows a logical order through the area identi- fying the degree of any possible pain. The questions then follow a logical order down the body covering all the general points of the body. The results can then be passed on to a sports rehabilitation practi- tioner for further focused functional assessment of the identiﬁed problem areas (Dawson et al.2009). Assessment by the means of questionnaire is not, of course, a new methodology, but the integration with functional and physical tests to form a holistic process is. The way in which the screening elements are integrated into the injury prevention process can have a large impact on the athletes involved. If ath- letes feel part of this process then they could take ownership and really fully commit to the measure that is ultimately proposed."}
{"id": "748", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "If athletes are insufﬁ- ciently involved then they might see the process and resultant programme as unnecessary and therefore not worthy of expending too much energy on. The other situation is where the athlete could learn too much and become de-motivated about their long- term future in the sport and as a result not commit. The latter two scenarios will mean that the practi- tioners plans may fail and the problems identiﬁed will probably arise with a negative effect on perfor- mance. A more simplistic approach to questionnaires can also produce good results in reducing the amount of tests that an athlete needs to perform. The re- duction of testing time is important in large squads as the amount of time the practitioner spends with the athlete reduces the amount of time the coach can spend working on sport-speciﬁc training. There- fore, the need to develop a useful tool to identify the members of the squad who do not need any further testing or those who can be dealt with in a reduced fashion is important. The process shown in Figure 2.2 indicates a simple pathway to group the squad into different levels of testing through a simple set of questions. This has been shown to be reliable in iden- tifying conditions and more importantly not missing any problems. The questionnaire again needs to be administered by a practitioner to insure the validity of the answers (Berg-Rice et al.2007)."}

When the same process was completed by a non-practitioner only 80% of cases where posi- tively screened. Although the results of the screening process show that it needs to be conducted by the rel- evant practitioner, the overall impact on the average number of days lost through injury was still similar 23 (non-screened) versus 21 days. This suggests that stringent follow-up tests are still needed to ensure that problems are dealt with effectively (Berg-Rice et al.2007). The initial questionnaire used for screening can also access the athlete’s psychological state towards injury and the social factors that could affect their own approach to problems.

The athlete’s injury history will have an effect on their ability to deal with injury and how they rate their current musculoskeletal state. The OMPSQ factors into the score: fear avoidance; how well the person perceives they can deal with pain; how distressed they have been in the past about injuries; and the athlete’s own rating of their function. These scores were then com- bined and factors given to the rating to produce three predicting factors of how many days the athlete will miss on average a year. The ﬁrst predicting factor was the function group of questions, which signiﬁcantly (p = 0.001), predicted the amount of ‘Sick’ days the athlete would have over the course of a three-year period (Westman et al."}

The way in which it categorises pain can also be varied with global, intense and gen- eral terms, all being used to interact with the patient to help them identify their pain. There is a need for a ‘golden measure’ of assessment of patient pain, and the VAS seems to be the most commonly used method at present (Litcher-Kelly et al.2007). Functional assessments can follow a screening questionnaire or be the injury prevention process in its entirety. The test used to functionally assess an athlete can be varied and differ depending upon the area of the body and the activity the athlete com- petes in. The back and knee are two of the major areas that the screening process needs to assess due to their importance to locomotion and therefore the resultant sporting performance.

Subjects were then asked to complete the exercises shown in Figure 2.4. On completion of the exercises the subjects were then asked to re-evaluate their pain scores on the VAS. Using the Revels model the subjects were cat- egorised into groups that had met the criteria and those that had not. The groups that had met the crite- ria had a further assessment on the lower back joints. As previously stated this only produced a positive result in those subjects with very general problems, but was signiﬁcantly linked (p = 0.04) to the patients amount of ‘sick days’, i.e. those with a positive Rev- els test had a greater number of ‘sick days’ (Laslett et al."}
{"id": "760", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2004). The safety of tests like the Revels model has been questioned due to the danger imposed by possible further damage to existing injuries. The condition of most concern is vertebral artery dissection (VAD). When assessing the back, practitioners must ensure that the patient’s history is fully recorded before examination, ruling out any symptoms for VAD. The patient should be assessed initially by means of non-provocative manipulation. If the area of the cervical spine needs to be manipulated then the practitioner should ensure that all symptoms for VAD have been eliminated and decide whether the provocative manipulation results are necessary or conclusions can be drawn through other means (Thiel and Rix 2005). Another area on the body that is of paramount importance to the practitioner is the knee. An injury to the anterior cruciate (ACL) is one of the most serious problems that can happen to an athlete and have a serious effect on their career (Bonci, 1999). The prevention of injury to the ACL and the knee is very important and is dependent on identifying a se- ries of risk factors. The major risk factors associated with ACL injuries include lower extremity malalign- ments, ligamentous laxity, lower extremity muscular strength considerations, neuromuscular control, hor- monal inﬂuences, intercondylar notch width and the biomechanics of the athletes’ sporting techniques (Bonci, 1999)."}
{"id": "761", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The rehabilitator can only improve and modify the strength and neuromuscular control risk factors, which is why these are key areas of a screening process (Bonci, 1999). The misalignment of the body can increase risk of injury, particularly in the back and knee.and this is very important in the lower limbs in athletes. The locomotion part of any sport technique means that any problem with the lower limb will be subjected to extreme forces. The knee in particular can only absorb a certain amount of these forces and through the nature of sport the ath- lete will at some point suffer injury as a result. The degrees of misalignment that will cause sufﬁcient risk to cause potential knee problems is varied, de- pending on several assessments (Bonci 1999). (For greater detail regarding ACL injuries see Chapter 21, The Knee.)In order to gain a full assessment of these risks, the athlete’s foot pronation, knee recurvatum, tibial torsion and posture need to be measured. Neu- romuscular control tests for the lower limb often involve a variety of movements but with common goals: to obtain an objective assessment of function and to challenge dynamic knee stability during land- ing and deceleration (Bonci 1999). A range of tests can be used to achieve these goals, with the single- leg hop, one-leg vertical jump, timed hop, ﬁgure of eight running, side stepping and stair running being a few of the commonly used ones (Lephart et al."}
{"id": "762", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "1991). These tests can also be combined with isoki- netic testing to give a rounded picture of the knee (Barber et al.1990; Lephart et al.1991). The way the athlete’s foot lands during their gait has a large impact on the distribution of the force created. If the level of pronation is too high then one of the body’s natural shock absorbers, the heel, will be un- able to prevent force from travelling up to the knee. The contact phase is where the level of pronation in the foot is critical. If the correct amount is present the movement will be inefﬁcient and shock absorption will not occur adequately in the heel."}

Pronation is important to the support phase, but not as stated in the contact to the shock absorption problems (Bonci 1999). The navicular drop test is commonly used to assess the pronation of the foot, and identiﬁes the difference between the subtalar joint (STJ) in a seated neutral position (position A in Figure 2.5) and a weight bearing position (position B in Figure 2.5). Athletes who have had ACL problems generally have a difference of 13mm when compared to healthy individuals who will have a difference of just 8mm (Bonci 1999). Genu recurvatum is also known as knee hyperextension and is normally due to problems in the athlete’s skeleton and/or move- ment pattern abnormalities and proprioception. The problem is often increased due to soft tissue laxities, which cause occasional hyperextension of the knee."}

An athlete with two or more postural problems that can be interlinked can have an increased risk of knee injuries. The increase of the Q angle can be an indicator of a problem occur- ring in the knee and of increased strain being placed on the ACL. The Q angle is the angle between the force line of the quadriceps and the line of pull of the patella tendon (see Figure 2.6) (Merchant, et al."}

The varity of methods used to assess the Q angle has caused problems with the standardisation of the results found.

If, for ex- ample, the hamstring is more than 15% weaker than the other lower limb muscles than the athlete is 2.6 times more likely to suffer lower limb injury (Knapik et al.1991; Gabbe et al.2009). Muscle im- balances between limbs as well as within are impor- tant in assessing the potential for injury in the knee, particularly in females where such imbalances are found in 20–30% of athletes (Bonci 1999; Gabbe et al.2004). The ratio of ﬂexion and extension of the joint is also a measure of potential injury, where an athlete with a ratio (eccentric to concentric) of less than 0.75 are 1.6 times more likely to suffer knee in- juries (Moul 1998). Isokinetic testing at 60, 180 and 300 degrees can help accurately establish these ratios and therefore identify potential problems, but this is very sensitive to velocity changes in the testing pro- tocol (Moore and Wade 1989). Traditional functional assessments can also provide this information, albeit, at a lower degree of accuracy, but still establish the athletes’ readiness for competition. The neuromus- cular control of the athlete can be measured through a series of jumps and hops to assess the stability and awareness the athlete has of their knee movement."}

Isokinetic testing can be used in a variety of ways to proﬁle an athlete to identify potential areas of in- jury concern. The simplest method is to evaluate the power output of the movements associated with the sport played and compare these against the competi- tive requirements. If there is a deﬁcit then the athlete is more likely to be at risk to injury when performing that movement and can be discouraged from doing it until their power output is improved (Rosenblum and Shankar 2006). When this is complete it has been found to offer about a 10% reduction in in- juries (Rosenblum and Shankar 2006) (see Chapter 3, assessing performance for greater detail regarding isokinetic assessment). The ﬂexibility of the muscles in the lower limbs plays an important role in the prevention of injuries to the area and should go hand in hand with a muscle development programme. The role of equipment used in the athletes’ chosen sport can also have a major effect on the potential injuries that they could suffer. For example, the height of the saddle in cy- cling can have implication for a range of conditions in the knee of cyclists. If the saddle is too high the Figure 2.7 Metatarsal head position (Callaghan 2005). Reproduced, with permission, from Callaghan, M. J. (2005)."}

If conversely the saddle is too low then the athlete could suffer from patellofemoral pain, LBP and anterior knee pain (Callaghan 2005). The tech- nique of the athlete needs to be addressed to ensure that there are limited biomechanical faults, which could also lead to injury. The way in which cyclists position their feet on the pedal (see Figure 2.7) is important for two main reasons. If the position is incorrect then the cyclist’s cadence and resultant power will be affected and performance will be hin- dered. Secondly if the foot is incorrectly positioned it can cause knee and back problems depending on whether it is either too far forward or too far back. The ability to rotate the heel using the toe as a ﬁxed pivot is also important to reduce stress on the knee and also increase efﬁciency of movement (Callaghan and Jarvis 1996). Through kinematic analysis using pressure plates in the clips the optimum reduction of pain in the knee whilst minimising the impact on the power phase of cycle can be found.

The role of the practitioner in assessing the athlete for potential injury should not just involve functional anatomical test but should look at the sport as a whole (Callaghan 2005; Callaghan and Jarvis 1996). The problems that an athlete could potentially have are not just conﬁned to the major joint of the back and the knee, the musculoskeletal system also needs to be assessed for any potential abnormalities. A simple Gait Arms Legs Spine (GALS) test can be used to help identify abnormalities (Beattie et al.2008). The testing procedure has been found to be 95% accurate at helping to identify musculoskeletal abnormalities. Figure 2.8 shows the characteristics that the athlete will be assessed with, with an over- all score worked out at the end. The Gait is sim- ply classiﬁed as abnormal or normal, and then the arms, legs and spine are identiﬁed by appearance and movement. The appearance of the limb will ﬁrst be assessed for abnormality and then the movement of the limb will follow using the same process. The subjects are also asked general questions about any pain or stiffness in their muscles or joints (Beattie et al."}
{"id": "770", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2008). The GALS offers a useful screening of the mus- cles and with very little deviation between practi- tioners, up to 95% agreement in this research feature (Beattie et al.2008). GALS does, however, offer different results depending on the condition, with it providing 53% of positive results with acute condi- tions versus 95% in chronic conditions. This high- lights the potential problems with diagnosing and screening musculoskeletal problems. The length of time that athletes have had the issue will affect the way they answer the questions and how it will appear to the practitioner. The variability of the issues can mean that there is no ‘golden test’ for screening and a holistic approach to screening is the best approach to increase accuracy of the results and therefore in- crease injury prevention (Beattie et al.2008). The assessment of an athlete’s gait can often lead to the identiﬁcation of potential and current muscu- loskeletal problems. This can be completed by the practitioner ‘eye balling’ athletes as they walk or run in front of them or through the use of a biomechan- ics."}

The history of gait analysis can be traced as far back as Leonardo da Vinci (Paul 2005). The aims are relatively still the same although with many more varied applications and not merely in the interest of locomotion. An ath- lete’s gait can be looked at extensively in terms of performance improvements, especially in elite sport where even the small percentage improvement of ef- ﬁciency could lead to success. Gait can also be used in the prevention of injury through the identiﬁcation of where the forces are travelling during locomotion and their possible impact (Paul 2005). The use of a force plate can greatly enhance the accuracy of the screening process by being able to easily identify imbalances between the left and right limbs. The ex- act forces can be measured and their direction so a picture of how much of an impact a gait abnormal- ity will have on the athlete can be drawn up. Figure 2.9 indicates a normal foot trace and resultant hip forces generated by the athlete. The forces can be expressed in terms of percentage body mass or any unit of force the practitioner wishes to work in (Paul 2005).

When an injury occurs the body adapts by ensuring extra force is exerted by the surrounding tissues, for example the ligaments and other supporting muscles. When the muscle has recovered from damage the extra force continues to be exerted by those tissues and there- fore the muscle becomes deactivated and untrained (Komura and Nagano 2004). Deactivation can affect other muscles causing an overall reduction in force output. For example, if this occurs in the iliopsoas then there can be a resultant reduction of power in the soleus. This can have a large affect on the athlete’s technique and therefore performance, so ideally you need the other tissues to compensate for the injured muscle without having any long-term effects on technique (Komura and Nagano 2004). The muscles which seem to have the greatest impact on the gait of an athlete are the gluteus medialis (GMED), gluteus minimus (GMIN), hamstrings (HAM), adductor longus, adductor magnus, tensor fasciae latae, gluteus maximus (GMAX), iliopsoas (ILIPSO), rectus femoris (RF), vastus (VAS), gastrocnemius (GAS), soleus (SOL) and the tibialis anterior (TIBANT) (Komura and Nagano 2004). If the RF is damaged then the knee movement is created by the VAS so there is not a loss of motion. When the GMAX is deactivated hip extension is caused by the GMED and the Ham. When looking at knee extension when the HAM is deactivated the VAS created the movement to allow locomotion to continue (Komura and Nagano 2004)."}

Knowledge of the movement and which muscle can perform the movement can help in correctly assessing injury or potential problems. Rather than assuming that there are no issues surrounding the GMAX because the athlete can successfully perform hip ﬂexion, the practitioner needs to identify whether the movement is completed by the correct muscle. If this process is not completed then an injury could go undiagnosed during the screening process leading to problems in the surrounding areas and technique at a later date (Komura and Nagano 2004). The potential problems will not only be limited to the surrounding muscles and ligaments but also the bones. During locomotion bone on bone contact force is apparent, but limited when the correct muscles are activated. If those muscles become deactivated then bone on bone force increases and can result in injury. The movement of force is also increased as the bone on bone forces have been shown to increase in other joint in the limb. If the HAM and ILIPSO are deactivated then not only are the bone to bone forces increased around the hip but also in the ankle due to the resultant muscles, the VAS, having to create the missing force. Deactivation of the GMAX increased the bone on bone force more at the knee rather than the hip as would be expected with the GMED and HAM creating the force instead of the GMAX, (Komura and Nagano 2004)."}

The body’s ability to maintain locomotion is undoubtedly a positive aspect but in a sporting context the hidden damage that could be caused is a problem. The need for a screening pro- cess to highlight fully and in depth which muscles are damaged and so could become deactivated as a result is required by the practitioner to ensure the long-term health of the athlete (Komura and Nagano 2004). The need for sporting bodies and teams to adopt a proactive approach to injury prevention is very ap- parent as is the need to increase education of coaches and athletes so as to improve performance. An ex- ample where this is being completed is in cricket (Dennis et al.2008). Functional tests will probably be the backbone of a sports team’s screening process due to the ease of setup and accessibility to trained staff to administer the tests. The screening process usually consists of a battery of functional tests which the members of the squad will complete en masse. The knee extension test is usually used to assess the athlete’s hamstring muscle length. The athlete will lie in a supine position with their hip ﬂex on the tested knee at an angle of 90 degrees."}
{"id": "780", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The athlete will then be asked to ﬂex the knee to its maximum position and the angle recorded. The ﬁnal value will be 90 minus the recorded angle. If the athlete can extend fully, the hip will be moved to a 30 degree position and the recorded angle will be subtracted from 120 degrees (Dennis et al.2008). The Modiﬁed Thomas Test (MTT) can be used to assess hip abduction range and hip extension. The test is performed over the edge of a plinth with the athlete lying in a supine position (Figure 2.14). The abduction and hip ﬂexion movements are then carried out with assistance from the practitioner and a goniometer is used to record the angle achieved (Dennis et al.2008)."}

The athletes’ calf heel raises and ankle dorsiﬂex- ion ability are also important in cricket especially in bowlers. The athlete is asked to lung towards a wall and the maximum distance they could keep their feet planted on the ground whilst still touching the wall with their knee is recorded for their dorsiﬂexion ability. The athlete needs to repeatedly perform calf raises to full height until failure, with the amount and duration they complete used to calculate their cycle per second ﬁgure (Dennis et al.2008). The bridging hold (see Figure 2.16) assesses the gluteal musculature endurance. The athlete is asked to support the lower back to prevent arching whilst their leg position is being conﬁrmed and the length of time they can hold this position is recorded.

From this data the practitioner can assess areas of weakness and potentially plan a pre- ventative injury programme to ultimately improve performance levels through a reduction in injuries (Dennis et al.2008). The implementation of injury prevention within sport is varied, dependent on the sport and possibly linked to the ﬁnancial ability of the team or individ- ual to employ the correct practitioners to implement such support. In the Australian football league, stud- ies have shown that coaches have a limited education in preparation of the squad practices when it comes to injury prevention."}
{"id": "788", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The general trend in football is for coaches to focus on maintaining core temperature and to work on ﬂexibility. Although these elements are important to injury prevention in a contact sport, procedures should be implemented in training ses- sions to reduce lower limb injuries (LLI). The pre- vention of LLIs can be completed through the use of lateral movement practices and foot work drills. The coaches were also lacking in knowledge about how to treat old injuries and how to avoid re-injury. The importance of a cool down is also an area that needs improvement with the traditional approach of concentrating on the warm up before practice being the dominant injury prevention measure and nothing planned post practice. The coaches agree that this lack of knowledge needs to be addressed through coach education to improve performance (Twomey et al.2009). Validity and reliability of screening methods When screening athletes for injury prevention it is important for the practitioner to remain objective towards the client and ensure that the recorded re- sults are valid and therefore reliable. If the measure- ments are being administered by a team of practi- tioners then the inter-practitioner reliability needs to high. Good inter-practitioner reliability is achieved by each test being performed using the same protocol and by having the failure points standardised."}
{"id": "789", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Figure 2.17 indicates the reliability of a series of well-used musculoskeletal screening tests and the difference between two practitioner’s results. The practitioners were asked to perform the series of tests shown in Figure 2.17, which were repeated using the same subjects (Gabbe et al.2004). In the majority of tests only the MTT of the quads indicated a signiﬁcant difference between the practi- tioners, but this difference was within the error range for this test as it was within 95% of the standard error measurement (SEM). The other tests, the sit and reach, the lumber extension, the slump test, the active hip internal rotation range of movement (IR ROM) test, and the active knee extension (AKE) test, indi- cated excellent inter practitioner reliability (Gabbe et al.2004). The sets of tests assessed are well used in the ﬁeld of musculoskeletal screening so the re- liability of the testing protocols needs to be good,as does the education of the practitioners in the use of the tests, as indicated in this research (Gabbe et al.2004). The ability of the practitioner to produce the same measurement between clients and on the same client over a series of visits is paramount to the test.

The problems arising from the two proto- cols occur due to the use of very similar movements to complete the test, and, although these are very small errors, this is something that needs to be mon- itored. The ability to maintain objectiveness is im- portant and, as the results show in Figure 2.18, this is the case when using these screening tests (Gabbe et al.2004). The use of video analysis can enhance the relia- bility of the test results and can be used in the ﬁeld as well as in a clinic or laboratory situation. Many of the tests that have been discussed are functional as- sessments but practitioners can also perform a series of ﬁeld-based movements that will enable strength screening to be completed. The ﬁeld tests can be recorded and software used post completion to com- plete the measurements and increase the accuracy of the test. Figure 2.19 outlines a series of ﬁeld tests that give an indication of muscular strength and any pos- sible imbalances that might exist within the athlete. The results indicate excellent SEM values for the en- tire test batch displayed, demonstrating the validity of the protocols (Miller and Callister 2009).

The use of this type of test battery could be implemented on large squads where time is limited to complete the screening session. The use of video analysis and the simplistic nature of the tests do not decrease accuracy, as the values in Fig- ures 2.18 and 2.19 indicate, but also help to increase objectivity (Miller and Callister 2009). The use of video analysis would also allow the practitioner to use more dynamic tests in the screening process to ensure that the athletes place similar forces on the body that they would experience in their sport. The static measurements are important but they need to be supported with dynamic movements to ensure that the screening process is sports speciﬁc (McClean et al.2005). The need to have objective measures and not let personal views interfere with the screening process is important and vital to the success of the injury prevention plans and the reputation of the practi- tioner. The need to ensure that practitioners have common core objectives and common protocols is also apparent in the increasing multi-cultural and cosmopolitan nature of today’s sport.

These objectives can only be achieved through maintaining high training stan- dards and ensuring continued professional training is compulsory amongst practitioners (Coady et al.2003). Risk assessment in injury prevention Injury prevention and musculoskeletal screening is a form of assessment of risk on an athlete. The process can be as detailed as the practitioner desires but the loss of accuracy will suffer with a lower detailed screening process. Rather than viewing this process as a collection of singular tests, it should be viewed as building a picture of the athlete’s functional capabilities, a performance matrix. Once this matrix is established the ‘weak links’ can be worked on to improve the overall matrix and therefore the resul- tant performances of the athlete. The sites used in the proposed matrix are upper neck (UP), lower neck (LN), upper back (UB), shoulder blade (SB), shoul- der joint (SJ), low back/pelvis (LB/P), hip (H) and lower leg (LG).

The movement is then scored in detail using the scheme indicated in Figures 2.22 and 2.23. This one movement effects scoring for ﬁve sites and seven directions, giving an indication of the ease at which a complex picture can be built up of the athlete (Mottram and Comerford 2008). The athlete’s weak links can be improved through targeted training which is possible as the site and direction of movement is clear. The use of core sta- bility training is often used to help improve the weak links. Where motor control needs to be improved low threshold training is found to rectify both global and local problems effectively. Once the motor control abnormalities have been rectiﬁed at a lower threshold level they can then be built on at a higher level to ensure the weak link is improved. Training an athlete to ensure that they are prepared for injury needs a detailed proﬁle of the athlete’s strength and weaknesses (Mottram and Comerford 2008)."}

With the correct identiﬁcation of weak links, injury prevention programmes can become more specialised and therefore meet the needs of an individual athlete to eradicate potential problems occurring due to the body overcompensating due to a weakness (Mottram and Comerford 2008). If the athlete is not prescribed appropriate conditioning to reduce the risk then problems will still occur. The conditioning should be functional and appropriate to the athlete’s sport. The conditioning must match the sporting movements, associated muscle actions, directional changes, velocities and loads experienced during the sport."}

The athlete’s ability to deal with pain can also be used to gauge how well they might deal with an injury and whether they could potentially mask an injury (Westman et al.2008). The range of functional tests is vast but the practitioner needs to be objective in testing so that valid and reliable results are achieved and the whole process is not undermined (Gabbe et al.2004). The use of biome- chanics to add further detail to the analysis should not be overlooked as a history of injury can often be confusing and the details gained from traditional screeningmethodsalonemightnotsolvetheproblem (Whiting and Zernicke 1998). Finally, injury preven- tion is the assessment of risk as to when an athlete is going to break down (Mottram and Comerford 2008). A new approach to screening through the use of a performance matrix can help target weak links and improve these potential breakdowns, therefore enabling sporting performance to continue uninter- rupted (Mottram and Comerford 2008). Recommendations For a detailed musculoskeletal screening process the following stages are recommended: 1. The screening process should start with a detailed examination of their perception of where they might have pain, using the examples shown in Figures 2.1 and 2.8."}

To achieve this, programme designers must: (1) analyse the de- mands of the sport; (2) identify the individual char- acteristics of the athlete (strengths and weaknesses; training history); (3) tailor and prioritise training to allow each individual athlete to meet these speciﬁc demands. To effectively test an athlete’s ﬁtness, and there- fore develop an appropriate training and rehabilita- tion regime, sports rehabilitators and strength and conditioning coaches must identify the essential components of the sport/activity in question. This ‘needs analysis’ requires the gathering of accurate, precise and reliable data, ideally from the published literature, combined with detailed observation of training and competition. Appropriate ﬁtness tests can then be selected and conducted, with compar- isons made to determine individual strengths and weaknesses that inform the implementation of ap- propriate training that focuses on the sport, the ath- lete and any identiﬁed injury risk. It is essential that the sports rehabilitator develop an applied awareness of such methods of assessing an athlete in order to complement their clinical assessments/skills when determining an athlete’s readiness to return to sport. A more detailed understanding of the demands of the sports will also be invaluable in terms of implement- ing effective and evidence-based injury prevention programmes. The primary aim of this chapter is, therefore, to ex- plore how to conduct an appropriate needs analysis. The chapter begins with an exploration of the dif- ferent components required in order to undertake an effective needs analysis, including the metabolic and mechanical demands of the sport/activity. This leads the reader on to a section on ﬁtness testing, which discusses the variety of testing modalities available, and includes some discussion of the validity and re- liability of these methods."}

Analysing the demands of sport To analyse the speciﬁc demands of the sport, sports rehabilitators must consider the demands placed on the muscular, nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, respiratory and skeletal systems. They must con- sider the length of the event; the type, speed and frequency of movement involved; the pattern of play and work–rest ratios; the nature of contact with other players or opponents; and the competition structure. They must consider the combined demands of both training and performance and the injury risk that arises in each. They must consider the nutritional and psychological demands of the sport, and the ef- fect that these may have on performance, recovery and rehabilitation.

{"id": "816", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "40 ASSESSMENT AND NEEDS ANALYSIS In general, the demands of sport can be cate- gorised as those with a metabolic emphasis and those with a mechanical emphasis. Metabolic demands The metabolic demands of a sport are determined by the biochemical pathways used for energy pro- duction in that sport. These energy pathways pro- duce adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP), the only source of energy for muscular contraction. There are three systems responsible for energy production, the phos- phagen system, the glycolytic system and the aerobic system. The phosphagen system is a very powerful system producing large quantities of ATP from phosphocre- atine (PCr). Unfortunately, the combined stores of ATP and PCr (the phosphagen system) only provide enough energy for 6–8 seconds of intense muscular contraction. The phosphagen system therefore pre- dominates in sports requiring short duration, maxi- mal intensity bouts of effort. These include weight lifting, high jump and short sprints (60, 100 and 200m). The phosphagen system therefore plays a crucial role in team sports requiring multiple short bursts of activity. The glycolytic system is another powerful sys- tem for producing ATP for high-intensity activity."}
{"id": "817", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "It is less powerful than the phosphagen system but can produce ATP for longer. Like the phosphagen system, the glycolytic system starts working imme- diately exercise starts but, unlike the phosphagen system, it takes about 5 seconds to reach maximal production capacity and lasts for 30–40 seconds at maximal intensity. The glycolytic system therefore predominates in longer duration, high intensity ac- tivities (e.g. 400m), and during the sprint ﬁnish of longer events. It therefore plays a crucial role in the performance of all athletes. Together the phospha- gen and glycolytic systems are anaerobic, or oxygen independent. The aerobic system is oxygen dependent and can produce vast quantities of ATP very efﬁciently, but at a much slower rate. Again, the aerobic system starts producing ATP as soon as exercise begins but does not reach full capacity for several minutes. The aerobic system therefore predominates in events re- quiring high levels of endurance. These events in- clude continuous, long duration, moderate intensity events such as rowing, cycling and distance running, but also team events, where high intensity bursts of activity (phosphagen system dominated) have to be repeated throughout the course of a long game (up to 90 minutes). During these latter events, the aerobic system plays a crucial role in replenishing phospho- creatine and therefore dominates during the recovery between bursts of activity."}
{"id": "818", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Although it is tempting to categorise sports into phosphagen, glycolytic and aerobic dominated, it is essential to remember that most sports require a combination of all three sys- tems. For example, football utilises the phosphagen system most during the repeated high intensity bouts of activity, the glycolytic system most during ex- tended periods of high intensity play, and the aerobic system during recovery phases (including half-time); a two-hour training session, for an elite sprinter, will focus each individual activity on the phosphagen and possibly glycolytic system, however, each bout of re- covery will be aerobic. This must be accounted for in training. Training should reﬂect the speciﬁc nature of en- ergy system usage by targetting the dominant path- ways, but must also recognise the contributing role of the other systems. Within each sport there is clearly room for variety and a change of focus as the training year progresses; however the ultimate goal is maxi- mal performance in a speciﬁc task. For team sports, however, it is essential to determine whether it is an athlete’s aerobic performance, or sprint perfor- mance that is the limiting factor, and therefore form the primary focus of training. Mechanical demands Movement specificity The mechanical demands of sport determine the movements that athletes should train. Exercises that are similar to the actual movements encountered in sport should be prioritised; for example, there is a triple extension of the ankles, knees and hips during a vertical jump and therefore exercises that involve a rapid extension of these joints, such as squat jumps, the clean or snatch, should be targetted. By focusing on movement pattern speciﬁcity, athletes can rein- force and condition the motor programmes used in skilled performance. These programmes control the"}

The more practiced and efﬁcient these programmes, the better the performance of the skill. For example, a rugby player who focuses practice on the foot patterns required to side step an opponent can enhance side-stepping performance by execut- ing quicker, more efﬁcient motor programmes during the game. However, these are generally trained and reﬁned during skill training. The training methods that transfer best to actual sporting performance usually involve coordinated movements across multiple joints rather than strict isolation exercises. In sport, no muscle works in isolation. Isolating speciﬁc muscles, then, is non- functional; gains in strength, power or endurance occur only in the trained muscle and fail to inte- grate with the whole movements required for sport- ing performance. Athletes must consider how to train movements, not muscles. Training that focuses on the whole movement enhances sports performance more effectively than the training of isolated joint movements (Bompa 1999; McGill 2006). Moreover, closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercises have a greater effect on functional performance when compared to open kinetic chain (OKC) exercises (Augustsson et al.,"}

Muscle action As well as training to produce force, it is also es- sential to develop an athlete’s ability to accept force. Sport requires athletes to reduce and absorb exter- nal forces, often at high speeds, in three dimensions, and in an unpredictable environment. Athletes must train for deceleration and force-acceptance as well as force production. Training tends to focus on con- centric force development; however, many sports re- quire heavy load eccentric muscle actions, which can also be high velocity, especially during rapid de- celerations and changes of direction. Eccentric train- ing, jump landings, dynamic control and stabilisa- tion training, along with speciﬁc jumping and agility drills, will increase an athlete’s capacity to control and manage the speciﬁc forces encountered during sport. For example: athletes typically train hamstrings by using knee ﬂexion exercises (leg curls) and hip extension exercises (stiff-legged deadlifts). In func- tion, however the hamstrings also act to control and decelerate the limb (as in kicking a football), act antagonistically to the rectus femoris to prevent hip ﬂexion (as in squatting or jumping), and act as an ACL agonist by preventing anterior tibial translation (Li et al.1999; Ebben and Leigh 2000)."}

Direction and velocity of force Sporting movements often require athletes to pro- duce and accept forces in multiple planes, at var- ious speeds, all in a ﬂuid and ever-changing envi- ronment. Sports rehabilitators, athletes and coaches therefore need to identify what these movement pat- terns are and, where safe to do so, tailor training and rehabilitation to mimic these. For example, func- tional movement patterns are enhanced by training at greater speeds, in multiple directions, and under varied and unpredictable conditions. This challenges an athlete’s balance and proprioception, enhancing their ability to stabilise joints and maintain posture, allowing the transfer of forces efﬁciently from one body section to another. Exercises that incorporate fast eccentric loading in the initial phases and place a high demand on an athlete’s ability to dynami- cally stabilise their joints under varying conditions also allows them to develop greater control and ac- cept higher forces quickly."}

For example at the beginning of the race, when a sprinter drives out of the blocks and accelerates up to full speed, the ground contact time can be greater than 200ms (Mero 1988; McKenna and Riches 2007), whereas when the athlete reaches peak running velocity, the contact time is nearer to 70–125ms (Kunz and Kaufmann 1981; Mann and Herman 1985; Moravec et al.1987; Chu and Korchemny 1993; Weyland et al.2000; McKenna & Riches 2007). Once the demands of the sport have been analysed it is essential to determine to what extent each athlete can meet those demands. This is achieved through ﬁtness testing. Fitness testing The importance of fitness testing To determine the current status of an athlete’s ﬁtness, and monitor the progress made during both train- ing and rehabilitation, speciﬁc components of ﬁt- ness must be assessed. Fitness testing allows coaches and rehabilitators to identify an athlete’s strengths and weaknesses, enabling them to tailor and adjust training and rehabilitation according to the athlete’s greatest need(s). This optimises the use of training time and resources, helping to achieve maximal per- formance gains and enhance rehabilitation as efﬁ- ciently as possible. Regular ﬁtness testing provides vital information to athletes and their support teams and should therefore form part of any athlete’s de- velopment programme."}

For tests to be effective and reﬂect the changes in an athlete’s ﬁtness they must be valid and re- liable, repeated at regular intervals using carefully controlled procedures, and be understood by ath- letes and coaches. To ensure this, the principles of validity, reliability and objectivity must be taken into account. Validity, reliability and objectivity Validity refers to what is actually measured. Some tests directly measure that which is required; what you see is what you get. For example, in a 40m sprint test, time is recorded and, if electronic tim- ing equipment is used, the time recorded is an ac- curate reﬂection of the time taken to complete the test; in a maximum strength test the highest weight lifted is recorded (1 repetition maximum – 1RM); and in a skin-fold calliper test, skin-fold thickness is recorded. In the latter case, the measurement of skin-fold thickness is only a measure of skin-fold thickness, not body fat. The calculation of body fat is an estimation based on prediction equations (Jack- son et al.1980; Pollock and Jackson 1984)."}

This is the extent to which scores are consistent and repeatable across time or between testers, and therefore reﬂects the ability to detect actual changes with time. Even di- rect measurements may be subject to errors. For ex- ample, if a 40m sprint is timed by hand, the time- keeper must determine when the athlete started and ﬁnished. There may be a delay as the brain pro- cesses this information and also a delay before the button is pressed and the clock stopped. Hand tim- ing, then, relies on an individual interpreting what they see and deciding when to press the button. This inbuilt inaccuracy may be greater than any differ- ences in actual time between testing sessions, and so may not be sensitive enough to reﬂect legitimate training improvements. Other challenges to the re- liability of tests include variations with equipment, test environment, the weather, warm-up procedures, or subject motivation between testing sessions. In terms of assessing body composition via skin fold measurements, errors in testing can include improper site selection and measurement, use of different cal- lipers, and intra- and inter-tester variation (Pollock and Jackson 1984).

A labo- ratory allows the same test to be reproduced under similar conditions on separate occasions. This in- creases the sensitivity of the test and allows subtle changes in ﬁtness to be monitored over time without interference from varying environmental conditions (Table 3.2). Field-testing, in contrast, has a number of ad- vantages over laboratory-based tests. Tests can be devised that more closely mimic the requirements of the particular sports. For example, the changes of direction that occur in the Multi Stage Fitness Test (Bleep Test), and particularly the yo-yo test, closely resemble some of the movement character- istics and work–rest ratios of team sports. It could be argued that performance in the yo-yo test gives a better indication of a soccer player’s ability to per- form in an intermittent multi-directional activity like soccer, than their performance in a laboratory-based treadmill test. Castagna et al. (2006) found that VO2 max data collected via the yo-yo test was strongly and signiﬁcantly related to VO2 max (r = 0.75, p<0.001) via treadmill direct gas analysis in adult male soccer players."}

In a review of literature, Bangsbo et al., (2008) concluded that the yo-yo intermittent recovery test is a simple and valid method of as- sessing an individual’s capacity to perform repeated intense exercise bouts, and monitoring changes in performance capacity. Additional considerations, when selecting testing methods, are time and reproducibility. In terms of the use of the yo-yo test for team sports, it is far more time efﬁcient than individually assessing the whole team, and it is also highly reproducible if the testing conditions (clothing, equipment, time of day, warm- up) remain constant. If working with a marathon runner, however, the most valid and reliable method of assessing aerobic capacity would be via direct gas analysis. Field tests also have the advantage that they are simpler, easier to set up and administer, and can often be applied to several athletes at once. As each athlete has minimal disruption to their routine, ﬁeld tests may therefore be the most practical choice for regular monitoring of training gains."}

Test order When conducting several tests, the order in which the individual tests are performed is vital. The perfor- mance of a previous test can impact the performance of a subsequent one. For example, a test to assess anaerobic endurance requires a high intensity of ef- fort for an extended duration, causing considerable fatigue and leaving the athlete below normal capac- ity for some time. Any subsequent tests, performed whilst the athlete is still fatigued, will be severely im- paired. If that test is agility, and on a re-test the athlete scores higher than before, then athletes and coaches cannot conclude that agility has actually improved.

All of these may al- low the athlete to start the agility test in a better state of readiness and therefore record improvements that are not necessarily down to improvements in agility. To ensure that any changes recorded actually re- ﬂect genuine improvements, the impact of previous tests must be minimised. The National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) (Baechle & Earle, 2008) suggest the following test order (Table 3.3). Agility and speed are tested ﬁrst as they are short, relatively non-fatiguing activities that require only a few minutes for full recovery. Testing these early will not impact later results. Strength should be tested next, again because the actual tests require little recovery (5 minutes) and have little impact on subsequent muscular or cardiovascular endurance. Muscular/Anaerobic endurance should be tested Table 3.3 Test order 1 Agility 2 Speed 3 Muscular strength 4 Muscular endurance 5 Aerobic capacity (ideally on a separate day) after strength as these tests can induce fatigue in the muscles and has a major impact on subsequent strength, skill and speed performance.

The choice of tests should reﬂect the characteris- tics of both the sport and individual player position. For example, a cycle based test will have almost no transfer to sports that require athletes to run; a strength assessment using a bench press will not necessarily transfer to throwing or punching activ- ities; a constant-pace running-based endurance test for a goalkeeper will be less functional than a test of repetitive explosiveness or agility.

Depending on where tests originated, distances may be expressed in metres or yards. In reality, a 40m test is no better or worse than a 40 yard test. The important issues to consider are consistency across time (when repeating tests) and an awareness of any differences when comparing test results to normative data. Assessing agility Shuttle runs are widely used as a test of agility, pro- viding information on explosiveness, acceleration, deceleration, turning ability, functional lower body strength and body control. No agility test should last longer than about 10 seconds. Beyond this, perfor- mance is determined far more by an athlete’s speed- endurance capabilities than agility. With all agility runs, careful placing of extra tim- ing gates (before and after the turn) can help estab- lish whether improvements in overall performance are the result of improved speed or improved turn- ing ability. T-test The T-test is a 40m (or 40 yard) agility test (Figure 3.2) that incorporates forward sprinting, side-to-side shufﬂing and backwards running. It is particularly suited to both team and racquet sports."}

Illinois agility test The Illinois agility test (Figure 3.3) is designed to test acceleration, deceleration, cutting and turning ability. Performance is determined by the time that is taken to complete the course. The use of timing gates is essential. Speed The best way to test an athlete’s speed is to assess their performance over sport speciﬁc distances. For example, short sprints, lasting 10–40 m, are used to mimic the sprint distances typically observed during Figure 3.2 T-test."}

These short sprints are the best way of assessing functional speed as they actually do measure short sprint ability. Because they all start from standing, they also give an indication of explosiveness and acceleration ability. As with all such tests (including agility tests) timing must be performed with timing gates or similar electronic method. (Hand timing is not an acceptable method of timing, due to the level of accuracy/reliability.)Sprint tests Tests consist of three sprints from a standing start, with full recovery between runs. The best time is always taken. Some researchers take the average of three; however it is usually not appropriate to use this method as a single poor result can skew the recorded ﬁgure. Starting position and height of the timing gates also needs to be standardised."}

Cronin and Templeton (2008) also observed an error of ≤1.3% (equal to 0.7s) be- tween the times achieved with the gates positioned at hip and shoulder height. This was attributed to the legs breaking the beam earlier with the gates posi- tioned at hip height. A 40m-sprint test, with an additional timing gate placed at the 20m- ine, gives useful extra information on an athlete’s initial acceleration. The distances can be altered for different sports to make the test sport speciﬁc. Vertical jump tests Vertical jump tests are widely used to assess single- and double-legged vertical jumping ability. They fo- cus on a particular performance parameter (height jumped) and in this respect are highly functional to those sports requiring vertical jumping ability, such as basketball and volleyball. Variations of the test can include, a two-legged take off, a one-legged take off, a step and one-legged take off (tennis, soccer), or measuring the height jumped after a drop off of a small platform."}

The ﬁrst uses contact mats to deter- mine ﬂight time. The second is a simple jump and reach method. Both methods appear to be valid and reliable tests (r = 0.967 and 0.906 respectively) when compared to a three-camera motion analysis system (Leard et al.2007). Another method is to attach a linear position transducer to a belt/harness that the athlete wears. On jumping, the device records the lin- ear displacement during each jump, and can provide reliable data regarding jump height, peak force (intr- aclass correlation coefﬁcient (ICC) = 0.977–0.982), mean force (ICC = 0.924–0.975), and time to peak force (0.721–0.964) (Cronin et al.2004). Although vertical jump tests do not measure power (they measure height jumped, unless per- formed on a force plate), the ability to jump high is closely correlated with this parameter. This rela- tionship has permitted the development of prediction equations for peak power output during the verti- cal jump, which removes the need for force plates to monitor athletes’ peak power during the vertical jump."}

Vertical jump assessments can also be performed with additional load (also referred to as squat jumps), depending on the requirements of the sport, however these do require the use of a force plate to determine peak power output, peak force and rate of force de- velopment. In trained individuals, high test–retest correlations (ICC range: 0.75–0.99) are observed during unloaded and loaded jump squats (30 and 60% 1RM) with familiarisation not necessary due to low individual variation (CV range: 1–2–7.6%) between tests (Moir et al.2005). Maulder and Cronin (2005) adapted the vertical jump from a bilateral to a unilateral test and found that test–retest reliability remained high (ICC = 0.86 dominant leg, 0.82 non-dominant leg). Performance of unilateral assessments can highlight limb asym- metries and therefore act as a potential marker of injury risk. Horizontal jump tests Horizontal jump tests are useful to assess power in a horizontal direction. Tests, such as the standing long jump and the standing triple jump, where the athlete attempts to jump for distance from a standing start, give useful information, not only about an athlete’s horizontal hopping ability but also about an athlete’s ability to control their landing.

Each hop is performed as in the triple hop for distance, with the only difference being that the athlete must cross the measuring tape during each hop. Research has demonstrated a high level of reliability (ICC r = 0.93–0.96) with a standard error of measurement of 15.95–17.74cm (Bolgla and Keskula 1997; Ross et al.2002).

Especially when combined with the results of assessments such as the hop tests. The SEBT is performed with the athlete standing on the middle of the grid (see Figure 3.5) on the leg to be tested. The grid consists of lines extend- ing out from the centre at 45 degrees (see Figure 3.6). Foot position should be standardised with the heel in the centre of the grid and the big toe on the anteriorly projected line.

It is a relatively simple and inexpensive test that is reliable and repeatable (especially in moti- vated subjects), is sensitive to change over time, and truly reﬂects a person’s anaerobic performance capacity. Although the test is well established and widely used in an educational setting, its applica- tion to most sports is limited. Highly speciﬁc for sprint cyclists, but not functional for other sports; however a number of studies, summarised by Inbar et al. (1996) have found strong associations with some ﬁeld tests for assessing power, including 40m sprint speed (r = 0.84) and vertical jump (r = 0.70), but weak associations with others (Sargeant anaero- bic skating test, r = 0.32). There are also a number of modiﬁed versions of the WAnT, with varying loads and varying durations. When monitoring peak power output, these are all highly reliable, but it is essential to use the same loads if comparisons of peak power are going to be made at a later date.

It is important to consider the validity of using such laboratory tests to predict on-the-ﬁeld perfor- mance, especially when the mode of laboratory test- ing (e.g. cycling) is mechanically different from the requirements of the sport (e.g. sprinting and jumping). This was highlighted by Baker and Davis (2002), who found that peak power output during a modiﬁed WAnT was unrelated to sprinting (10, 30 and 40m) and jumping (vertical and horizontal) performance, however, jumping and sprinting test performance were highly related (r = 0.80–0.91; p<0.01). Assessing strength and muscular endurance Strength is deﬁned as the ability of a muscle group to develop maximal contractile force against a resis- tance in a single contraction. Muscular endurance is the ability of a muscle group to exert sub-maximal force over repeated contractions or for extended pe- riods. When assessing strength and muscular endurance we must therefore take account of the speciﬁc strength requirements of the sport. These include range of movement, joint angle, body position, type of muscle action (concentric, eccentric, isometric), and also velocity of movement and the speeds at which strength must be applied. It should therefore be possible to both train and assess strength in a functional manner. There are three major areas of strength assess- ment: isotonic, isokinetic and isometric."}

One repetition maximum test To record an accurate test score for 1RM the fol- lowing procedure should be followed (adapted from Kraemer and Fry 1995): 1. Warm up with 5–10 repetitions of the test exercise at a load of 40–60% of estimated 1RM. Rest for 1–2 minutes"}

Note, a novice may require 6–7 attempts to reach their 1RM. A more experienced lifter, with a more accurate perception of their true strength, may need 3–5 attempts. Because 1RM testing requires maximal effort, it is usually conﬁned to the more familiar free-weight squat, deadlift and bench press exercises. Wisloff et al. ("}

Moreover, Baker (2001) found a strong correlation (r = 0.87) between maxi- mal strength, during the bench press, and peak power output during bench throws using a variety of loads.1RM testing, however, may not always be functional, and any interpretation of results, or predictions of fu- ture performance based on these results, should take this into account. Furthermore testers should be aware that athletes unfamiliar with the test will under-perform when compared with more experienced lifters. As such, tests should always incorporate a familiarisation pe- riod prior to testing to account for any learning effect. Three or five repetition maximum test Many athletes, particularly if they do not lift free weights regularly as part of their conditioning pro- gramme, are not always comfortable with the max- imal effort required for 1RM testing. As such it may be appropriate to conduct a 3RM or a 5RM test instead. Strength is still being assessed (there is a high correlation between 3RM and 5RM scores and 1RM scores), but the athletes may be hap- pier with a sub-maximal (but still very heavy) load. It is important with all strength and local muscu- lar endurance assessment to ensure that technique remains constant throughout the test and between testing sessions. A rigid and repeatable set of in- structions should be used to ensure that the tests remain reﬂective of actual changes in performance."}

Thigh muscle imbalance appears to be an indica- tor of increased risk of injury (Engstrom and Ren- strom 1998), with an imbalance between the ham- strings and quadriceps (eccentric hamstring to con- centric quadriceps ratio of ≤1:1, or a conventional concentric hamstring: quadriceps ratio of <2:3) indi- cating increased risk of hamstring injuries (Knapik et al.1991; Yamamoto 1993; Croisier et al.2002; Cameron et al.2003; Foreman et al."}

The major disadvantage, however, is that the movements are restricted to single joints and the velocity is usually limited to slow, non-functional, speeds. Furthermore it is useful to know the angles at which these peak forces occur (or at least what the relationship is when the quadriceps are produc- ing peak torque) and how this relationship changes as the velocity of movement increases towards func- tional speeds."}

Examples include the maximal grip strength and isometric grip strength endurance of a rock climber. AEROBIC ENDURANCE The most widely available tests for aerobic en- durance are those performed with the minimum of equipment. Such tests include those that can be per- formed ‘in the ﬁeld’ such as the multi-stage ﬁtness test (MFST) or ‘bleep’ test, yo-yo test, 3-kilometre run, 5-kilometre run, 1.5-mile run, 12-minute run. Other more sport speciﬁc tests may include time- trials for cycling or rowing. For example, 10000m row or 20km cycle performed on a cycle or rowing ergometer. Yo-yo endurance test The yo-yo endurance test appears to have a good level of reliability (Castagna et al.2006, 2007) (see Table 3.1). Metaxas et al. (2005) also concluded that yo-yo ﬁeld tests should be used to monitor aerobic ﬁtness in team sports, as they are easy to adminis- ter and incorporate into training sessions during the competitive season."}

Similarly, Metaxas et al. (2005) found a 10.5–13.3% variation, in VO2 max measurements, assessed via the yo-yo endurance test, yo-yo intermittent test, and continuous and in- termittent treadmill tests. However, a review of lit- erature, Bangsbo et al. (2008) concluded that the yo-yo intermittent recovery test is a simple and valid method of assessing an individual’s capacity to per- form repeated intense exercise bouts, and monitoring changes in performance capacity. Additional consid- erations when selecting testing methods are time and reproducibility. For team sports, the yo-yo test, may be a far more time efﬁcient method than individ- ually assessing the whole team, and also remains highly reproducible if the testing conditions (cloth- ing, equipment, time of day, warm up) remain con- stant. If working with a marathon runner, however, the most valid and reliable method of assessing aero- bic capacity would be via direct gas analysis. For one individual testing duration would be similar whether using direct gas analysis or a maximal prediction method, such as the yo-yo test."}
{"id": "860", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Graded exercise test A graded exercise test (GXT) in a human perfor- mance laboratory can reveal greater detail in terms of maximum oxygen uptake and anaerobic threshold but it is often the length of time that an athlete lasts in such a test that is the best (and simplest) predictor of functional performance ability. Graded exercise tests involve a progressive increase in exercise intensity and are designed such that the athlete lasts between 10 and 12 minutes before the point of exhaustion. These tests must be speciﬁc to the athlete’s sport and use large muscle groups. In a laboratory, the usual criteria for determin- ing VO2max include: a respiratory exchange ratio >1.15; heart rate (HR) in last stage ±10 beats.min−1 of HRmax; and/or a plateau in VO2 with increasing work rate. Needs analysis for different sports In certain sports, particularly those well supported by the literature, it is possible to formulate a detailed needs analysis. Below are example needs analyses for football and rugby league. For sports where the published literature is lacking it is essential that all of the demands of the sport are considered in terms of the demands of the sport, as identiﬁed earlier in this chapter. Initially, this needs to focus on the dominant energy system re- quired, followed by the velocity of movements, force generation and force acceptance, direction of force application and development. Once these concepts have been decided the rehabilitator can determine the methods of assessment that are essential to test, and also which components of ﬁtness/performance need to be prioritised."}

The distance covered during the game is generally di- vided between walking (25%), jogging (37%), sub- maximal cruising (20%), sprinting (11%) and mov- ing backwards (7%) (Shephard and Astrand 2000). The multiple sprints average 10–15 metres (2–4s in duration, approximately every 90s), interspersed with jogging, walking, running backwards, and rapid changes in direction. There are approximately 50 rapid, high-velocity movements in amateurs (With- ers et al.1982) and 150–250 rapid, high-velocity movements in elite athletes (Bangsbo et al.2006). The rapid, high-velocity movements involve high- force eccentric and concentric muscle actions, while maintaining balance and control of the ball (Hoff 2005). Fatigue usually occurs, during a game due to glycogen depletion, however temporary fatigue between multiple short sprints may result from tem- porary depletion of intramuscular phosphocreatine concentrations (Bangsbo et al."}
{"id": "862", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2006). Average VO2max measurements of football play- ers appear to be above 60ml.kg.min−1, with individ- ual measures sometimes exceeding 70ml.kg.min−1; average body mass and percentage body fat are approximately 77kg and 10% respectively (Reilly et al.2000a,b; Arnason et al.2004; Hoff 2005). More speciﬁc data is presented in Table 3.5. It is worth noting that the data in Table 3.5 is ‘nor- mative’ and not necessarily optimal. For example research has shown that increasing VO2max leads to an increase in performance on the pitch. Helgerud et al. (2001) found that increasing VO2 max by 10% (58.1+4.5 to 64.3+3.9ml.kg.min−1) improved run- ning economy (6.7%), increased distance covered by 20%, increased the number of sprints by 100%, and resulted in a 24% increase in the number of involve- ments with the ball. It is also essential to acknowledge that energy expenditure, during training sessions and competi- tion, has been estimated between 1400 and 1800kcal, dependant on playing position (Reilly et al."}

In relation to the energy expen- diture during training, it is also worth noting that elite squads regularly train twice per day making rapid and efﬁcient replenishment of energy substrates es- sential. Football injuries When conducting a needs analysis it is essential to identify the common injuries, and their causes as this may inform the choice of screening tests used to identify injury risk. During two seasons of professional English foot- ball, it has been shown that the most common types of injuries were hamstring strains and anterior cru- ciate (ACL) injuries, accounting for up to 21% and 8% of all injuries respectively (Hawkins et al.2001; Woods et al.2002, 2004). The majority of ham- string injuries in football are non-contact in nature (Hawkins et al.2001; Woods et al.2002, 2004; Hagglund et al."}
{"id": "864", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2005; Walden et al.2005), high- lighting that the risk of injury is intrinsic and may be offset through appropriate conditioning. The litera- ture suggests that there are two non-contact mecha- nisms responsible for hamstring strain; one resulting from high speed running (Yamamoto 1993; Woods et al.2004), and the other during stretching move- ments carried out by extreme range of motion (ROM) (Askling et al.2002), both resulting in high veloc- ity eccentric loading (Kujala et al.1997; Cameron et al.2003; Brockett et al.2004). The strain is most likely to occur during two stages of the running cy- cle; late forward swing and toe off (Stanton 1989) as, at this stage, the hamstrings decelerate hip ﬂex- ion and knee extension (Hoskins and Pollard 2005) resulting in large eccentric loads.

It is also essential to progress on to higher velocity eccentric exercise such as plyo- metrics (deceleration training), which has also been shown to have a beneﬁcial effect in preventing and rehabilitating hamstring strain injuries (Kaminski et al.1998; Brockett et al.2001, 2004; Proske &"}

For example, hamstring strains accounted for 21% of injuries re- ported during two seasons of professional English football (Hawkins et al.2001; Wood et al.2002, 2004). The most common injuries reported in rugby league are also musculotendinous injuries to the lower limbs (Hoskins et al.2006), with hamstring and groin injuries making up 8.0–19.7% of all re- ported injuries (Seward et al.1993; Gibbs 1994; Or- chard 2004; Gabbett and Domrow, 2005). An un- derstanding of the pathophysiology of muscle injury and repair is essential in order to provide the op- timum treatment interventions and to limit injury or re-injury to a muscle. Reducing the risk of re- injury is an essential component of the rehabilitative process, as musculoskeletal injuries such as ham- string strains are compounded by a high recurrence rate of 12–31% with approximately 1 in 13 athletes re-injuring within the ﬁrst year of return to sport (Dadebo et al.2004; Petersen and Holmich 2005; Orchard and Best 2002)."}

Developing a detailed under- standing of this process will help the sports rehabili- tator to treat such injuries effectively and efﬁciently, thereby reducing time to return to sport and recur- rence of injury. The chapter will culminate in a case study that will provide the reader with an applied example of this process. Anatomy Skeletal muscle consists of both contractile and non- contractile elements. The non-contractile elements provide a framework for individual muscle cells and encase the nerves and blood vessels (Jarvinen et al.2005). The connective tissue is composed of three levels of sheath: the epimysium, a dense ﬁbrous sheath surrounding the entire muscle belly; perimy- sium, which binds together muscle ﬁbres to form fas- cicles; and the endomysium, which surrounds each muscle ﬁbre (see Figure 4.1). The connective tissue sheaths are continuous and extend beyond the muscle to form myotendinous junctions. This means when a muscle contracts it pulls on the sheaths, which in turn transmit the force to the bone to be moved (Kossmann and Huxley 1961; Huxley 1975; Jarvinen et al.2005)."}

Each muscle ﬁbre contains a large number of myoﬁbrils, which are the contractile elements of the muscle and consist of protein myoﬁlaments. These are actin (thin ﬁlament, isotropic, I bands) and myosin (dark ﬁlament, anisotropic, A bands) and it is these bands that give muscle its striated appearance. These my- oﬁlaments are organised into repeating functional units called sarcomeres. In a resting muscle the actin ﬁlaments overlap the myosin to a certain extent. Each myoﬁbril is surrounded by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is a store for release of calcium (Kossmann and Huxley 1961; Huxley 1975; Lutz and Lieber 1999) (see Figure 4.2). Physiology Skeletal muscles are designed to produce voluntary movement by applying forces to bones and joints via a muscle contraction. When a muscle contracts the sarcomeres shorten. This is due to the ‘Sliding Sarcoplasmic reticulum Mitochondrion T tubule Sarcolemma Thick myofilament (myosin) Thin myofilament (actin) Myofibril Sarcomere Figure 4.2 A myoﬁbril."}

Filament Theory’ proposed by Huxley in 1954. The myosin ﬁlaments remain static and the actin ﬁla- ments slide in and out producing force (the A band remains a constant length; the I band becomes shorter). The force is generated by crossbridges forming between the myosin (via the globular myosin heads) and actin binding sites (Kossmann and Huxley 1961; Huxley 1975) (see Figure 4.3). For this to occur, the muscle ﬁbre is stimulated by a nerve impulse creating an action potential across the sarcolemma. The action potential is propagated down the T-tubules triggering the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The calcium binds to troponin, a regulatory protein on the surface of actin, exposing the actin binding site. A crossbridge is then formed between actin and myosin, resulting in a contraction cycle powered by ATP. Each muscle ﬁbre is part of a motor unit so a number of muscle ﬁbres are stimulated at the same time (Kossmann and Huxley 1961; Huxley 1975). Pathophysiology There are a number of types of muscle injury that can occur: laceration, contusion and strain (Garrett 1996; Huard et al."}
{"id": "906", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2002; Jarvinen et al.2005). A laceration occurs when the muscle is cut by an external object, this usually occurs during traumatic accidents such as road trafﬁc or industrial accidents. A contusion occurs when there is a compressive force to the mus- cle and usually occurs in contact sports (Jarvinen et al.2005), for example in football when two play- ers collide, knee to thigh in a tackle. Strain injuries occur when muscle ﬁbres cannot withstand exces- sive tensile forces placed on them and are therefore generally associated with eccentric muscle action"}

Strains most commonly occur in muscles working across two joints e.g. hamstrings, gastrocnemius (Jarvinen et al.2005) during periods of rapid acceleration and deceleration, by placing the muscle in a length- ened state over two joints and contracting forcefully (Stanton 1989; Farber and Buckwalter 2002; Brock- ett et al.2004; Hoskins and Pollard 2005; Askling et al.2006, 2007a, 2007b). When the muscle is strained the initial injury is usually associated with disruption of the distal my- otendinous junction and ﬁbres distal to this but still near the myotendinous junction. Injuries to the mus- cle belly only occur with the application of very high forces. The contractile elements are the ﬁrst tissues to be disrupted; with the surrounding connective tissue not being damage until high forces are applied (Has- selman, et al.1995)."}
{"id": "908", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The contractile elements are relative stiff in comparison to the surrounding con- nective tissue and hence become disrupted at lower forces than the surrounding connective tissue. Muscles heal by a repair process that can be di- vided into two phases: (1) the destruction/injury phase resulting in rupture and necrosis of the muscle ﬁbres; and (2) repair and regeneration. Destruction/injury phase This phase results in damage to the vascular sup- ply and as oxygen can no longer reach the cells, they die and release lysosomes (Schiafﬁno and Par- tridge 2008). Excessive force to a muscle ﬁbre results in tearing of the sarcoplasm and the cells respond by forming a contraction band (condensation of cy- toskeletal material) creating a protective barrier. The lysosomes are pivotal in this vital process keeping the necrosis to a local area and preventing it from spreading along the whole length of the cell (Jarvi- nen et al.2005). Within 15 minutes of injury the damaged tissue consists of disrupted extracellular tissue and dead cells, platelets and plasma, which themselves re- lease powerful enzymes such as thrombin thereby setting off an inﬂammatory cascade (Schiafﬁno and Partridge 2008). A haematoma is formed to ﬁll the gap between ruptured muscle ﬁbres. Clinically tissue inﬂammation presents as redness, heat, swelling and pain of the tissues. The redness, heat and swelling are due to an increased blood ﬂow and so blood within vascular beds in the area, with the swelling developing as a result of the increased local tissue pressure due to inﬂammatory exudates (local capillaries become more permeable) leaking into the interstitial space (Schiafﬁno and Partridge 2008)."}
{"id": "909", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The pain is due to the initial damage to lo- cal nerves and irritation of nerves in the area from the inﬂammatory chemicals release by the damaged tissue (Evans 1980). Repair and regeneration After the initial injury, the inﬂammatory chemicals released from the injured tissues attract lympho- cytes and macrophages to the area (Jarvinen et al.2005). Macrophage phagocytosis of the necrotic ma- terial then occurs removing the debris (Tidball and Wehling-Henricks 2007). The regeneration process starts within 3–6 days following injury, reaching a peak between day 7 and 14. The regenerative ca- pacity of skeletal muscle is provided by satellite cells, specialised cells underneath the basal lamina of each muscle ﬁbre. In response to injury they pro- liferate and differentiate into myoblasts and then become multinucleated myotubes (Jarvinen et al.2005). These then fuse with parts of the muscle ﬁ- bre that have survived the initial injury and attempt to breech the gap in the muscle (Lieber and Friden 2002). Recent ﬁndings have shown that bone marrow stem cells may play a role in contributing to regen- erating muscle ﬁbres and replenishing the satellite cells, however it is debatable as to how big a role this is (Gates and Huard 2005; Jarvinen et al."}
{"id": "910", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2005). At the same time as myotubes are attempting to cross the injury site, ﬁbrin is being laid down creating an irregular meshwork of short ﬁbres by the ﬁbroblasts, which have differentiated from the macrophages drawn to the area earlier in the process, this acts as a connective tissue scaffold (Schiafﬁno and Partridge 2008). This irregular ﬁbrin network obviously reduces the ability of the myotubes to cross the rupture and make good an effective contrac- tile unit. It is possible to minimise the irregular nature of this connective tissue mesh and also the amount present by applying suitable tensile loads (i.e. not high enough to cause re-rupture) (Lehto et al.1985). This regeneration process can occur rapidly, within 10 days post injury the injured muscle can regain much of its contractile ability with progres- sively applied loading, set at levels below the pain threshold (Nikolaou et al.1987)."}
{"id": "911", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "TREATMENT OF MUSCLE INJURIES 71 Treatment of muscle injuries It is frequently cited within the sports medicine liter- ature that the initial treatment of musculoskeletal in- juries should be rest, ice, compression and elevation (RICE). However, this acrimony is likely to be more valid in the less metabolically active tissues such as ligament and bone (Gates and Huard 2005). Muscle with its capacity for rapid regeneration due to the nature of its constituent tissues requires a modiﬁed approach (Peterson and Holmich 2005; Thorsson et al.2007). This modiﬁcation is based around the balance between absolute rest and the absolute level of loading to stimulate appropriately the rapidly developing tissues. Rest and mobilisation Early mobilisation, rather than immobilisation or complete rest, has been advocated (Thorsson et al.2007). Studies have shown early mobilisation aids with regeneration of muscle ﬁbres (stimulation of satellite cells and myotube formation improves cap- illary growth into the area and aids with more parallel orientation of collagen and muscle ﬁbres (Nikolaou et al.1987, Taylor et al.1993; Goldspink 1999)."}
{"id": "912", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The exact level of loading is difﬁcult to judge, it must be sufﬁcient to stimulate and challenge the de- veloping tissues, but not so great that it causes tis- sue breakdown (Kannus et al.2002). This includes early weight bearing to help promote scar tissue re-alignment (Croisier 2004; Jarvinen et al.2005) and controlled running to reduce muscle inhibition (Herrington, 2000) Immobilisation and poorly controlled early load- ing (low or high), have been shown to lead to the development of contracted scar tissue, which blocks the linking of myotubes across the injury, thereby stopping the formation of a functional contractile el- ement, and the surrounding areas then become more susceptible to further injury (Beiner and Jokl 2001; Lehto et al.1985). Ice Studies have shown that ice results in a signiﬁcantly smaller haematoma and less inﬂammation in the initial stages of the injury (Jarvinen et al.2005). Reducing tissue temperature results in vasoconstric- tion, thereby limiting the amount of bleeding in the area (Beiner and Jokl 20012). It also reduces the metabolic rate of the tissue and therefore reduces the demand for oxygen (Hubbard et al.2004) de- creasing the hypoxic damage."}
{"id": "913", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Clinical studies have shown the optimal duration to apply ice is for 5–10 minutes in the initial stages and repeat every 60 minutes (Croisier 2004; Hubbard et al.2004) within the ﬁrst 24–48hours to reduce the inﬂammatory effects. Compression and elevation Compression is an area where research is lacking, it has been stated that it results in a reduction in the severity of bleeding and swelling following an injury (Kannus et al.2002; Jarvinen et al.2005), though the only evidence often present in support of this theory is from studies involving ligament in- juries. A recent clinical study by Thorsson et al. (2007) utilising 40 athletes with calf injuries found compression resulted in no signiﬁcant difference in reducing muscle haematoma, or speed of recovery of the injury using compression Elevation is still one of the preferred and eas- iest methods of immediate management used in sports medicine for muscular injuries (Hergenroeder 1998). It simply relies on the use of gravity to promote venous return and lymphatic ﬂow to drive swelling/oedema from the area (Hergenroeder 1998). Again research is lacking in this area, with most authors when citing research, using studies on ankle ligament injuries and even here the actual pos- itive beneﬁts when the limb is dependent again are very limited (Tsang et al.2003)."}

Strengthening exercise Isometric exercise can begin after 2–5 days and should be performed within the limits of pain (Jarvinen et al.2005). Frequency, duration and in- tensity are limited by the patients’ pain. Some thera- pists advocate three sets of 10 repetitions using 5–10 second holds to begin with at intensity within pain tolerance (Pull and Ranson 2007). These then are un- dertaken at multiple angles, beginning in mid range then progressing to inner range (shortened position)"}

Dynamic movement and isotonic con- traction is then incorporated again starting in the strongest position (mid range, close to a 90◦joint angle) progressing to and ﬁnishing in the function- ally most relevant (outer range with eccentric and concentric contractions most often). There is preferential atrophy of type 1 muscle ﬁ- bres with disuse (Stockmar et al.2006), and high loads and rates of force development are most likely to over-stress the healing tissue. Therefore, initially an endurance based programme should be used, (three sets of 15 repetitions at 40–60% of one repeti- tion maximum) this would be progressed to strength (4–6 sets of 3–6 repetitions at 85–95% of one rep- etition maximum and then power training (3–5 sets of 3-5 repetitions at 75–85% of one repetition maxi- mum) (Kraemer et al.2002), or plyometrics depend- ing on the speciﬁc requirements of the muscle. The exact nature of the progressions, directions and ve- locity of movement will depend on which muscle has been injured and the requirements of the sport, as will whether or not the progressions have a major stability/proprioception element. Within the body certain muscles can be regarded as having a role that is predominately about the gen- eration of force/power and they tend to work mostly in a single plane (usually the sagittal) these are often called mobiliser muscles. Other muscles can be re- garded as having a stability role, they control motion of the body and often have the ability to contract in multiple planes; they are often called stabiliser muscles (see Table 4.1)."}

Similarly, those muscles that predom- inately work in an open kinetic chain manner will not require exercise progressions involving closed kinetic chain exercises. Stretching Passive stretching (at the end of available range) should be avoided for the ﬁrst 72 hours as a min- imal period, possibly the athlete should not stretch for the ﬁrst 7–10 days following injury (Neidlinger- Wilke et al.2002). The reasons for this are twofold. Firstly, the healing tissue is weak and intolerant of tensile loading and so is likely to be damaged by un- controlled stretching. The second reason is there is no physiological need in the early stages to stretch, as the scar does not beginning to shrink until around the tenth day post injury when ﬁbroblasts begin to be converted to myoﬁbroblasts and contract and draw the wound ends together. Prior to the tenth day post injury it would be more appropriate to take the mus- cle through its full available pain-free range without any attempt to force the muscle beyond this point. Once it is appropriate to begin stretching the mus- cle; that is, elongating the tissue beyond its avail- able range, then careful passive stretching can be performed."}

(1997) reviewed stretches at 15 seconds, 30 seconds and 60 seconds. They determined that 30 seconds was the optimum duration, also stating that longer periods after 30 sec- onds was ineffective in promoting additional stretch. As with strengthening exercises stretching exer- cises need to be progressed in order that the tissue adapts to the different types of load once the athlete is comfortable (pain free) with passive stretching (Bandy et al.1997).

It is thought to work at the cell membrane level, resulting in an ‘up regulation’ of cellular behaviour. This results in an improved rate of oedema dispersion, resolution of the inﬂammatory process and promotes a more rapid rate of ﬁbrin ﬁbre orientation and deposition of collagen (Robertson and Baker 2001). Another modality that can be used to help speed up a recovery muscle injury is therapeutic ultrasound. This is the use of high intensity sounds waves, which research has been shown can help recovery of tis- sues at a cellular level by increasing ion transport across cells and increasing metabolism within the cell (Wilkin et al.2003) and increasing ﬁbroblas- tic and angiogenic activity (ter-Haar et al.1978). However, evidence-based research remains limited in the effectiveness and reliability of therapeutic ul- trasound treatment with the majority of supporting evidence coming from in-vitro cell culture studies (Robertson 2002) even though many clinicians still use it as their main electrotherapy treatment. Muscle stimulation may prove a further useful electrotherapeutic adjunct for the treatment of mus- cle injuries. It has been shown to decrease oedema, muscle inhibition and the rate of strength loss with inactivity (Thornton et al."}

An understanding of the mechanics of the sport can be helpful in analysing the cause of the injury in the ﬁrst place. This information can normally be revealed during the initial subjective assessment of the athlete, using simple questioning such as ‘how did the injury happen, can you demonstrate (without re-injuring of course)’. Example of muscle injury (hamstring) Hamstring strains are one of the most common in- juries in sport and can result in a lengthy period out of the game if not treated effectively (Clark et al.2005). The hamstring is a two-joint muscle and is most susceptible to injury in sports involving sprinting and kicking (Stanton 1989; Brockett et al.2004; Hoskins and Pollard 2005; Askling et al.2006). The majority of injuries occur in the biceps femoris and at the mus- culotendinous junction, although they can also occur to the semimembranosus during stretching (Askling et al.2007b)."}

Hamstring strains are commonly reported in sprinters when speed is max- imal or close to maximal (Askling et al.2006) and during powerful eccentric muscle actions (Brockett et al.2004). The strain is most likely to occur during two phases of the running cycle; late forward swing and toe off (Stanton 1989) as during this phase the hamstrings decelerate hip ﬂexion and knee exten- sion (Hoskins and Pollard 2005) resulting in large eccentric loads. It has also been found that whilst sprinters sustain their injuries during high-speed run- ning, dancers sustain injuries whilst performing slow stretching type exercises (Askling et al.2006).

In particular, ultrasound may be used to assist in the breakdown of scar tissue and promotion of tissue healing, and is interferential in the reduction of swelling and inﬂammation (Wilkin et al.2004). Strengthening exercises are vital to try to prevent further injury. Initially starting with isometric and progressing onto isotonic as pain allows (Jarvinen et al.2005). As injury is most likely to occur during eccentric activity, it is vital that eccentric exercise is incorporated into the programme in the later stages. The Nordic eccentric exercise has been shown to improve the torque angle at the knee, and rugby union teams that incorporated it into their training programmes found a reduced number of hamstring strains (Kujala et al.1997; Clark et al.2005; Brooks et al."}

Eccentric training programmes should be closely monitored as they can lead to delayed onset mus- cle soreness; a low volume (3–5 sets of three repe- titions) high frequency (3–4 times a week) may be most appropriate. Exercises are then progressed to functional activ- ities (e.g. running/sprint training), a return to sport once there is full strength and pain-free movement,"}

As discussed earlier, sports speciﬁc rehabilitation is vi- tal to return the athlete back to their functional sport. Not only can this return the athlete back to sport quicker, but help prevent further injury later on. Functional ﬁtness must also be maintained throughout the rehabilitation process without aggra- vating the injury. Examples could include cycling, walking, upper body weights and swimming, so long as these are pain free (Croisier et al.2002). This would not be functional for most sports, but may be useful in reducing the detraining effect regularly associated with a reduction in training volume and intensity following injury. Prevention As stated in the example given there are a number of factors that can predispose to skeletal muscle injury and if these can be controlled/prevented then the risk of injury will be reduced. Examples may include adequate warm up and stretches prior to sports participation; a condition- ing programme consisting of eccentric, plyometric, sports speciﬁc and cardiovascular exercise and opti- mum treatment following previous injury (Kujala et al.1997; Herrington, 2000; Clark et al."}

As an example, a hamstring in a foot- ball can be caused by a running/sprint deceleration activity which incorporates eccentric control of the hamstring muscle at higher speeds. This eccentric control of muscle must be re-implemented within the rehabilitation programme once the initial in- jury is managed in order to rehabilitate the ﬁbre re- orientation and to help reorganise the neuromuscu- lar pathways which control the activity at such speed (Marqueste et al.2004). Therefore, as a simple exam- ple sports speciﬁc rehabilitation may involve sprint- ing over short distances with sudden stopping and re- sprinting in another direction over many repetitions in order to mimic the control required for football. To begin with, this may require slower timed sessions to begin with, and as time progresses, this process is speeded up to match speed. This not only helps recruit the right muscle ﬁbre type, but also helps restore proprioception and regain functional ﬁtness."}
{"id": "935", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Fatigue has also been shown to be a precursor to injury as a fatigued muscle is not able to absorb as much energy prior to failure due to a reduced ability to generate force (Mair et al.1996). Therefore, reha- bilitation should also be geared towards increasing the duration of rehabilitation sessions and trying to maintain ﬁtness even with injury. Using the example above, the footballer with the hamstring strain can still cycle, swim, aqua-jog to help maintain a certain level of ﬁtness without re-injuring the hamstring dur- ing treatment. Similarly, once the injury is repaired, emphasis should be placed on increasing duration of sessions, and hence helping to ensure endurance is not compromised. It can be seen that rehabilitation therapists have a vital role to play in preventing and treating injuries to skeletal muscle. Summary key points of muscle healing and rehabilitation r RICE should be implement as soon as possible following acute injury r Early mobilisation and weight bearing should also be encouraged r Stretching and strength exercises can start within pain-free range as soon as possible r Fitness and conditioning of the athlete should be incorporated within the early rehabilitation pro- gramme without compromising the injury r Speciﬁcity, and functional ﬁtness are imperative to help return the athlete back to sport without recurrence.

As such, their char- acteristics can affect the ability to generate appropri- ate forces when attempting, for example, ﬁne motor tasks, or indeed those tasks requiring high rates of force development. In order to be able to respond to these demands, the tendon is designed to be both rigid enough to enable efﬁcient transfer of forces from muscle to bone, but also compliant enough to allow storage of energy for later use. It is because of these diverse requirements on the tendon that they are frequently at risk of injury, both acutely where perhaps force has been applied in an unusual or inappropriate fashion, or chron- ically where micro damage has accumulated over time leading to trauma. This chapter will outline the tendon physiology from a molecular level to gross tissue level and how this relates to its function and its subsequent me- chanical properties. The tendon characteristics are then put in context of the action of muscle and ulti- mately the ability to produce functional force. Next, tendon injury will be discussed in context of its use both from an acute and also chronic perspective. The ability of the tendon to regenerate and opti- mal or appropriate healing strategies will also be put into a context and illustrated by appropriate by case studies. Basic tendon anatomy and physiology Tendon gross structure can be described as either sheet like or rounded. Some tendinous structures may be a combination of both, with the tendon being more rounded in the mid portion and tending to resemble sheet-like fascia at their attachments (aponeuroses) with the adjoining muscle."}
{"id": "956", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Within the tendon there is a structure consisting of closely packed collagen molecules, which are assembled into ﬁbrils, ﬁbres, ﬁbre bundles or sub fascicles, fascicles and tertiary ﬁbre bundles (see Figure 5.1). This arrangement of collagens into a hierarchical structure enables the tendon to resist tensile loading and ensures that there is minimal risk of catastrophic rupture. Each ﬁbre bundle is wrapped with a layer of connective tissue called the endotenon; blood vessels, nerves and lymphatic elements can pass through this layer to supply the tendon. The tendon is covered by an outer layer of connective tissue called the epitenon; this is contiguous with the layer below (endotenon). Most tendons are then covered with a looser outer layer paratenon; this tissue is lined with synovial cells and allows for tendon movement or gliding. Tendon consists of tendon cells (ﬁbroblasts) that lie in longitudinal rows and are elongated cells ex- tending within the tendon structure and communi- cate via gap junctions within the three-dimensional space of the tendon. Also there is the extracellular matrix (ECM) that forms the scaffold for the tendon Sports Rehabilitation and Injury Prevention Edited by Paul Comfort and Earle Abrahamson C⃝2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd"}

This can be understood as a dynamic mecha- nism responding to feedback signalling via mechan- otransduction pathways in an attempt to optimise the tissue characteristics to its function. Previous work has shown that tendon adapts to loading by modify- ing its mechanical properties and dimensions. Sim- ilarly it has been observed that tendon mechanical properties such as compliance are increased with un- loading due to regulation of structural proteins, i.e. collagens. In line with this is the observation that tendon elastic properties are associated with the at- tached muscle (Muraoka et al.2005) in that a muscle that is able to generate large force will generally be attached to a tendon that has adapted to cope with these forces. The mechanisms of how the tendon responds to mechanical signals at a cellular level are still not well understood but are thought to involve the transduc- tion of mechanical stressors via the ECM. The ECM forms the substrate for the anchoring of cells and en- ables the tendon to maintain its structural integrity. It has been suggested that forces generated end to end along the tendon are transferred along it by the matrix in shear connecting along the length of the discontinuous collagen ﬁbres (Ker 1999)."}

These molecules when activated for example via mechanical stress, can ini- tiate chemical signalling cascade processes, such as tyrosine phosphorylation, nuclear factor transcrip- tion factor (NF-kB), mitogen activated protein ki- nase (MAPK) pathway activation, either directly or as part of the process involving other growth factors (see Figure 5.2). Another ECM molecule that is re- ceiving some attention is tenascin C; this is also seen to be up regulated with mechanical stimulus and is a ligand for integrin. The actual role of tenascin in tendon tissue is as yet not clear, but may involve actions related to tissue remodelling and general maintenance of the intercellular structures enabling gliding of bordering collagen bundles (Riley et al.1996).

Functional aspects of tendon Tendon is sited between the muscle and bone and acts to transmit forces generated by the muscle to the bone to enable movement.

It is usual to describe the tendon response to load- ing in terms of strain (percentage change of length from rest) and stress (force per unit area).

Low load region (toe) shows characteristic greater strain than linear region, with subsequent plastic region leading to rupture. With respect to the strain, tendon has the charac- teristics of larger strain at low load, due in part to the crimp structure of the collagen ﬁbrils, and a linear region where strain is proportional to stress, beyond this point the tendon starts to become plastic in that it takes on a new resting length when the load is removed. If stress is continued to be applied then ul- timately tendon rupture will result (see Figure 5.4). Tendons with less crimp have been observed to fail before those with a more pronounced tendon crimp pattern (Wilmink et al.1992). This may be reﬂective of the mechanical connections between the collagen ﬁbrils and the ECM or some qualitative differences in the collagen structure.

Ker (2002) discusses ‘stress for life’, where a functional stress is determined from the ratios of the tendon to the muscle cross-sectional area (csa) and the product of the maximal isometric stress de- veloped by the muscle (0.3 MPa, Wells 1965), with ranges from 8–100 MPa, but more normally approx- imating 13 MPa. It can be seen then that in certain circumstances a tendon may be subjected to stress which may be nearing its rupture limit, for exam- ple the patellar tendon has been reported to be sub- jected to approximately 12.2 kN during actions such as competitive weightlifting (Zernicke et al.1977), but under normal circumstances there is a relatively large margin of safety. This is perhaps best illustrated by considering the tendons involved in locomotion, such as the Achilles; it has been determined that this structure may experience forces in the order of 7 kN during running (Komi et al.1992), this equates to ap- proximately 8.5 times body mass for an individual of mass 80 kg. This may be even greater during actions such as long jump or triple jumping and has been reported to be in the order of 9 kN during jumping (Komi 1990). However, with regard to tendinous damage, it is more likely generally that tendons suffer what is termed fatigue damage resulting from repeated load- ing cycles (see section on Chronic tendon injury). Tendon has been shown to become damaged at strain values approximating 15% (St¨aubli et al.1999), although these values have been previously reported to be as high as 30% (Haut and Pawlison 1990). A functional design aspect of tendon to help limit damage is that of the ability of the tendon fasci- cles to slide with respect to each other whilst simulta- neously transmitting forces along the tendon length."}

This may re- ﬂect differences in the collagen content and/or com- position between males and females. These gender differences do not seem to be retained in elderly tendon, however (Burgess et al.2009b), possibly re- ﬂecting the changing hormonal inﬂuences on tendon being less disparate between the genders with age and more similarities in lifestyle. At the levels of loading seen routinely, ten- don may suffer micro damage at levels of strain seen normally, that is below 10%, leading to ac- cumulated deterioration in tendon (see section on Chronic tendon injury). Normal ranges of strain un- der conditions of maximal isometric contraction for human tendon structures are within the ranges of 6–14%. The range of normalised elasticity (Young’s modulus) for tendon is approximately 0.8–2 GPa. This property represents the normalised (corrected for differences in tendon length and cross section) stiffness of the tissue and is the gradient of the stress- strain curve. As tendons are also elastic they tend to stretch when muscle contraction takes place."}
{"id": "970", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "If, for exam- ple, the external load is very heavy, then as the mus- cle contracts the tendon may stretch initially, the action of the tendon here could be thought of as sim- ilar to a spring being stretched and energy stored. This may be functionally important, an example of this could be where an athlete is sprinting or jump- ing and the tendon is being subjected to stretch- shortening cycles. This enables the movement to be carried out with higher efﬁciency than if the tendon did not stretch and then shorten, in that the tendon is initially storing energy during the stretch, to be released during the shortening or recoil period. It has been reported that tendon has the ability to re- turn ∼93% of its stored energy during the recoil phase, the rest being lost as heat energy (Alexander 2002). This particular property of tendon is perhaps useful where for example cyclical movements are being carried out with changes in kinetic and poten- tial energy or to increase the power component as in jumping. The tendon can act to help smooth out these changes and store some of the energy as elas- tic strain energy to be returned to the system when required, reducing the overall work required for the muscles (i.e. running). However, where high rates of Muscle length Force Short Long Figure 5.5 Length–tension relationship for skeletal muscle.force development are required, tendon compliance could be seen as potentially detrimental to optimal performance. The mechanical properties of the tendon, in par- ticular the stiffness, can also be seen to potentially affect the characteristics of muscle contraction. A muscle’s contractile ability in part is described by its length tension curve, by which the number of elements that generate muscle force (cross bridges) are increased or decreased dependant on the muscle length (see Figure 5.5)."}
{"id": "971", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Here it can be seen that if the tendon is compliant and stretches under load, the muscle will shorten, and this could affect its ability to generate force. As can be seen from Figure 5.5, if the muscle is starting from a position near maxi- mal force and the tendon stretches, the muscle will shorten moving down the force generating curve. The position where the tendon attaches to bone can have functional implications. A muscle can only extend or shorten over a given range; the points at which tendon attaches to the bone can thus affect the movement of the limb to which the muscle–tendon complex is attached. This can be seen to be useful from a functional standpoint where for example force is preferred over range of movement and visa versa (see Figure 5.6 for example). Here, where the tendon attaches closer to the joint centre of rotation as in Figure 5.6A, the limb being affected can move further for a given muscle shortening than where the tendon attaches further from the rotation centre (Figure 5.6B). This is at a cost of reduced torque generating ability. Tendon injury and its management Tendon injury can be debilitating in so far as a dam- aged tendon will likely reduce the capacity for trans- fer of forces via the muscle to the bone. This has obvious implications for a range of activities ranging"}

Injury to the tendon can be characterised as acute resulting in either a catastrophic rupture or a less ma- jor tear of the tendon tissue. Alternatively the tendon may suffer chronic pathological changes which may be inﬂammatory or not even detectable. These fac- tors can affect the tendon at numerous sites along its length. There appears to be no set consensus on description for the degenerative or pathological changes to tendon (see Table 5.2 for descriptors, taken from Wang et al.2006). With regard to acute tendon injuries, although a number of these could be identiﬁed due to extrinsic factors, such as direct contact with external body, or accidental unaccustomed loading such as extreme shear, the majority of acute tendon injuries show prior predisposing factors. These potentially con- tributory factors can be thought of as chronic inﬂam- matory or accumulative degenerative conditions and may be undetected prior to the acute trauma."}

More speciﬁc diagnosis of rupture can be carried out using imaging techniques, such as ultrasound (see Figure 5.7) or magnetic resonance imaging. Tendon injuries of this nature tend to be unilateral and of those re- ported for the achilles, 75% were related speciﬁcally to sport (Jozsa et al.1989 cited in Leppilahti and Orava 1998).

For example, achilles tendon ruptures typi- cally occur 2–6 cm proximal to the insertion site at the calcaneus. This area along with the insertion site is also known to be poorly supplied with blood (Carr and Norris 1989; Niculescu and Matusz 1988). Causes There are a number of factors which are thought to be responsible for acute tendon injury. These factors can be separated into intrinsic and extrinsic factors. A sudden, large force or torque applied through the tendon, perhaps at an oblique angle could result in a partial or complete tear. How this force or torque presents may be due to either environmental factors – incorrect or accidental placement of the limbs in con- text of the surface, abnormal surface conditions – and/or neural control mechanism failure, which may be accompanied by inappropriate muscle balance. But it is also suggested that in a number of acute in- juries to the tendon, prior predisposing pathological factors may have been present. Here, when strenu- ous activity is routinely carried out it is possible that cumulative damage may occur leading to a catas- trophic failure of the tissue (J¨arvinen et al."}
{"id": "976", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2001). The mechanisms underlying this will be discussed in more detail in section on Chronic tendon injury. It has been reported that males present with ten- don injuries more often than females, however, it is not clear if this is due to more participation in sport by males and thus more exposure to risk of injury (Clayton and Court-Brown 2008). Onambele et al. (2007) demonstrated qualitative differences between male and female tendons in young adults with fe- males having more compliant structures. Whether this would result in a tendon more likely to be in- jured is not clear, however, if the two tendon struc- tures have similar strain limits it might be suggested that for a given force the female tendon would be more likely to undergo permanent deformation and subsequent damage. More recently it has been reported that certain classes of drugs, including antibiotics (ﬂouroquino- lines) and corticosteroids, can affect the collagen tissue directly, leading to weakened structures that may rupture under high loading conditions (Sode et al.2007). The mechanism by which ﬂouroquino- lines are thought to increase the risk of tendon injury is linked to the increased activation of metallopro- teinase, a regulator of collagen degradation. There has been suggested association between an- abolic steroids use and tendon injury."}
{"id": "977", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Of the studies carried out in animal models there have been reports of morphological changes to the collagen structures. In humans, however, this has not been shown. Evans et al. (1998) examined tendon tissue from individu- als who had self-administered anabolic steroids for between 1 and 10 years. Subsequent light and elec- tron microscopy analysis of the tendon indicated no differences from normal. There is some initial case study evidence to suggest there is an associ- ation between steroid use and tendon rupture. One such case involved an individual presenting with a relatively rare case of bilateral quadriceps tendon rupture, which was subsequently suggested to be as- sociated with the earlier intake of anabolic steroids (Liow and Tavares 1995). Regarding the mechanism responsible for injury with the intake of steroids, it may be that as the ability to generate high forces increases due to the anabolic effects on muscle, the tendon simply cannot keep pace with this increased ability and therefore succumbs to injury. Previously, Unverferth and Olix (1973) showed, in a number of cases involving athletes who had received localised corticoid steroid injection of the tendon, that there was an association with the use of corticosteroid and subsequent tendon rupture. A series of experiments on animal tendons led them to suggest this may have been due to resultant dis- ruption of the tendon collagen matrix, and this was alignedwithareducedmodulusofelasticityforthose tendons."}

Mokone et al. (2005, 2006), showed a relationship between the COL5A1 and tenascin C gene and achilles tendon injury rates. These genes can be seen to be important to the struc- tural integrity of tendon as the COL5A1 gene is known to code for collagen structural components, whereas the tenascin C gene encodes for the extracel- lular matrix component tenascin C. This component is understood to be involved with the transmission of forces throughout the tendon and is a component that is upregulated in response to mechanical load- ing, suggesting a role in tendon remodelling. With respect to the optimal method for repair and subsequent rehabilitation treatment of tendon ruptures, no consensus exists. Although there is in- creasing evidence to suggest that where the individ- uals are relatively active and able, surgery may be advantageous, providing better functional capacity over non-operative options (Schepsis et al.2002); whereas, for those who are more sedentary, less in- vasive non-operative treatments may be advocated. The following case study illustrates the use of a re- cent methodology to aid in the repair of a ruptured rotator cuff tendon. Here a patient underwent surgery involving the use of a “cascade membrane” to knit the tendon and accelerate healing. The membrane consisted of a thin layer of autologous ﬁbre saturated in platelets, the idea being that platelets are responsi- ble for the production of growth factors responsible for promoting healing."}

After surgery the patient was immobilised for a period of four weeks and a standard rotator cuff re- habilitation protocol carried out. MRI examination of the repair after six months indicated a complete and robust repair of the ruptured tendon (Maniscalco et al.2008). Chronic tendon injury Definitions There are a number of deﬁnitions for chronic ten- don pathological changes generally associated with increased tendon usage, these range from terms to describe degeneration and the failing of the healing response, to those used to describe inﬂammation and morphological adaptation of the tendon tissue (see Table 5.3 for characteristics of tendon pathologies). A more general and suitable clinical term that does not attempt to describe the pathologies associated with the condition has been suggested as “tendinopa- thy” (Mafulli et al.1998). Causes Tendinopathy can be directly associated with the volume or intensity of tendon loading and this can be modiﬁed by other factors such as age, gender (Astr¨om et al.1998; Riley et al.2001), body mass, disease and oral contraceptives in females (Holmes and Lin 2006)."}

As a mechanism for ‘non-coping’ tendons, the vasculature supplying the tendon may have a part to play. Here the blood supply is required to provide requisite healing components as part of the process. If this system is not able to carry out this task optimally the tendon may not recover from the trauma. Previously poorly perfused tendon tissue has been linked with spontaneous tendon ruptures (Yepes et al.2008). Interestingly though, tendinopa- thy shows hypervascularisation of the tendon with- out an associated healing response, this contrast is difﬁcult to explain and may be indicative of break- down of the cascade system responsible for normal healing. This increased vascularisation has been re- ported to be responsible for the pain associated with tendinopathy (Alfredson et al.2003).

Hence, here it can be seen that either deep knee ﬂexion, high loading or a combination of both could predispose the tendon to injury where the architecture of the tendon–bone connection could cause increased lo- calised tendon strain. A common response to injury or damage is in- ﬂammation; hence the molecular markers of inﬂam- mation can be used to identify potential damage. Tendon responds differentially to cyclical loading or strain. A previous study examined the effects of strain on tendon expression of inﬂammatory me- diators. Where strains were relatively low, that is approximating 4%, no deleterious effects on ten- don were shown; however, with strains of 8% up-regulation of genes associated with inﬂamma- tion (COX-2, MMP-1 and prostaglandin E2) were noted (Yang et al.2005). This study suggests then that moderate load or strain may be appropriate for tendon homeostasis, whereas, higher loading can lead to damage, which may accumulate if frequent. Although inﬂammation is common to injury, it is generally thought that tendinopathy is not associated with inﬂammation. In that tendons generally present as painful and histological degenerative changes are evident such as increased cellularity and rounded cells rather than elongated or striated cells, along with ECM remodelling, which includes reductions in total collagen (Riley et al."}

Linear ultra- sound probes with a frequency range of between 7.5 and 15 MHz are able to spatially resolve superﬁcial tissue to less than 0.1 mm (Martinoli et al.1993). Ul- trasound imaging has been utilised to describe three different levels of tendinopathy: (1) normal tendon image, (2) enlarged tendon area, and (3) hypoechoic area to tendon (Archambault et al.1998). MRI is a very useful imaging methodology, in part because of its high spatial and contrast resolution, and is able to generate 3D images of the tendon structures; however, it is still relatively expensive and operator intensive in contrast to ultrasound imaging. Treatment Treatment of tendinopathy can be by a number of different methods."}
{"id": "986", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "As tendinopathy has been associated with increased vascularisation and also pain, a previous study examined the therapeutic value of utilising a sclerosing agent (Polidocanol) in order to try and reduce the localised vascularisation.¨Ohberg and Alfredson (2002) reported that the use of Poli- docanol in 10 patients presenting with achilles tendinosis resulted in 8 out of 10 patients showing improvements in the condition and reductions in vascularisation of the affected areas. A case study is presented here for a 35-year-old tennis player complaining of pain at the ﬂexor carpi ulnaris tendon site. The use of a sclerosing agent was applied based on the ﬁnding of neovasculari- sation of the injury site. Polidocanol (1.5 ml) was injected to the site of neovascularisation, guided by power and laser doppler spectrophotometry. This ini- tial treatment reduced the neovascularisation by ap- proximately 25%. Further treatment after a short rest was in the form of eccentric resistance loading (Ther- abands) of the forearm for a period of 12 weeks (6 × 15 repetitions day−1) after which the patient reported no incidence of wrist pain (Knobloch et al.2007). Tendon healing Tendons by nature have a much lower metabolic rate than associated tissue such as skeletal muscle, with tendon having an oxygen consumption of ap- proximately 13% of skeletal tissue (Zernicke et al.1977)."}
{"id": "987", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "This results in a much slower healing pro- cess than would be evident with higher metabolic rates. This less adequate metabolic process is partly due to the limited blood supply to the tendon tissue. Subsequent to injury there are distinct but overlap- ping healing responses, the early phase is delineated by inﬂammation, next the secondary phase involves synthesis and is termed remodelling, followed by the ﬁnal stage where reﬁnement of the tissue takes place and is appropriately termed the modelling phase. Cytokines, in particular neutrophils are associated with initiation of the inﬂammatory phase, vascular permeability is increased and damaged material is removed via phagocytosis, with monocytes and macrophages invading the damage site within the ﬁrst 24 hours. These mechanistic responses also bring about initiation of angiogenesis and tenocyte proliferation and migration to the damage site, which results in increased type III collagen synthe- sis. During the remodelling stage, which is evident after the ﬁrst two days or so, type III collagen synthesis continues to increase, with the peak occurring during this phase. Next, after a number of weeks there is a down regulation of collagen production, during weeks 6–10 there is a gradual change in the new tissue from cellular to ﬁbrous. It is during this ‘consolidation’ stage that the collagen ﬁbres align to the direction of stress. With time there is a gradual reduction in both the tenocyte activity and vascularisation of the tendon tissue injury site. In addition, during this period there is a changeover from predominantly type III collagen production to type I. After a period of approximately 10 weeks the remaining ﬁbrous tissue begins to be modiﬁed into tendon tissue that is scar-like, this process continues for up to one year and is sometimes referred to as the maturation phase."}

Injury to tendon can be categorised as acute or chronic. Where acute injury occurs it is suggested that predisposing factors are present in many cases. Overuse injuries can be described as chronic tendon injuries and fall into the description for tendinopathies. Clinical diagnosis of tendinopathies involves manual and visual elements. Pain may or may not be present, but changes to the tendon may include swelling, crepitus, tenderness, and or nodularity. Imaging has been utilised to help diagnose tendinopathy, both US and MRI are able to identify stages associated with tendinopathic changes, such as enlargement of the tendon and hypoechogenic ar- eas to the tendon. Treatments of acute and/or chronic tendon injuries are dependant on site of injury, activity levels or expectations of patient, the speciﬁc tendon injured and the grade of injury. Many treatments involving pharmacological in- tervention are available, for example NSAIDS have been used with some degree of success to reduce swelling and symptoms of tendinopathy. More re- cently, sclerosing injections have been utilised with good results to reduce the neovascularisation seen in some cases (described in earlier section)."}

Where surgery is advocated there are again many different methodologies present to repair tendon, this chapter has presented a recent development whereby growth factors are encouraged within the repair by use of a patch saturated with platelets. Rehabilita- tion of the tendon following either acute or chronic injury involves a period of rest or immobilisation followed by a gradual, progressive development of strengthening and mobilising exercises. Recently ec- centric exercise has been advocated as a particularly useful adjunct to successful rehabilitation of tendon injuries; suggested mechanisms for this include high frequency oscillation of force during loading (Rees et al.2008). In conclusion, tendon injury is a complex, mul- tifaceted issue. Injury can be cumulative or sudden and can appear suddenly without any precognition of a problem. Repair of tendon can take the form of surgery, which tends to have a better outcome in terms of functionality and time taken to get back to pre-injury levels of activity, or conservative, which usually results in fewer complications such as infec- tions. There is currently no consensus on the best form of treatment, either repair or rehabilitation. However, there are a number of recent developments that show promise."}

Later on, this chapter will illustrate this process by introducing two of the most common ligamentous injuries and their available treatments. Introduction Ligaments of the skeletal system are dense connec- tive tissues that attach bones across a joint. Liga- ments play an important role in the neuro-muscular system by providing joints’ stability and sending sensory feedback to the central nervous system with information about stress, tension, joints’ motion, stretch and pain (Riemann and Lephart 2002a). Anatomy Fibroblasts are the cells that reside in ligaments producing both the matrix and the collagen ﬁbre. Fibroblasts are arranged in longitudinal rows paral- lel to the ﬁbres and communicate with each other by a gap junction, a mechanism that is poorly under- stood (Chi et al.2005). The matrix is composed of proteoglycans and col- lagen ﬁbres. In ligaments the most common proteo- glycan is decorin, which strengthens the links be- tween collagen ﬁbres (Ilic et al.2005)."}
{"id": "1010", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Ligaments are made up primarily of type I col- lagen, with normally 1–2% oelastic ﬁbre (Frank 1996). During ligaments’ healing, type III colla- gen levels increase and this is the reason for the weakening of ligaments at that point (Frank et al.1987). Ligaments, such as ligamentum ﬂavum and ligament nuchae, have a different structure with a higher content of elastic ﬁbre, which allows recoil and saves muscular energy moving the spine back to the anatomical position from ﬂexion (Yong-Hing and Reilly 1976). Like other connective tissues, ligaments have a hierarchal structure (Figure 6.1). Each ligament is built by multiple fascicle units. Each fascicle carries the collagen ﬁbrils and ﬁbrob- lasts cells in longitudinal lines and encapsulates them in a loose connective tissue called endoliga- ment. Fascicles are separate enough to allow shear- ing movements occurring at different joint’s position (Frank 1996). The entire ligament is covered with a vascular epiligament, a loose connective tissue that does not undergo much tension during the ligament’s tightness (Ian et al.2002)."}

This is where the collagen ﬁbres fan-out and are attached diagonally to bones via the perios- teum.

One character of the fascicle is the “crimps” – a waviness of the ﬁbrils. The crimps give the ligaments its pseudo-elasticity and disappear once the ligament is stretched (Scott 2003). Many ligaments are attached to the joint capsule, tendons and other connective tissue and cannot be separated anatomically and functionally, hence the common injuries where more than one tissue is damaged. Blood supply The blood supply to ligaments deserves a special examination as in most cases it is the limiting factor in healing injured ligaments. Compared with other tissue, ligaments are hypovascular and their blood supply is better closer to the bones’ attachments; the middle section is poorly supplied (Bray et al.1996). The blood supply to ligaments may arrive from three places. The epiligament carries blood along the ligament, where blood vessels branch out to the endoligament and inside the fascicles. A build up of tension in the ligament will reduce the amount of blood circulating, but will recover at rest (Bray et al."}
{"id": "1013", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "1996). The periosteal blood supply supplies mostly the enthesis region of the ligament. The surrounding connective tissues such as fat, joint capsule or mus- cles may carry some blood that collaterally supplies ligaments (Arnoczky 1985; Bray et al.1996). Following injury, the vascularity increases for about 40 weeks while the ligament’s ﬁbres become disorganised. The increased vascularity allows heal- ing. The ﬁnal post-injury state is a reduced vascular- ity (compare to the pre-injury level) with poor vessel organisation in the scar tissue. Ligaments probably do not have the ability to keep the original vascu- lar organisation, causing reduced vascularity in the chronic healing stage, which may be the causes of higher level of reinjures.

Rufﬁni receptors are the most common mechanoreceptors in ligaments and joint capsule, whilst the others are Pacinian, Golgi tendon organ-like and free nerve endings. All of these receptors allowing the central nervous system to assess the amount of stress joints undergo and ex- ecute patterns of muscle contraction to help protect joints over stretching (Riemann and Lephart 2002b). Following an injury both the peripheral and central nervous system undergo modiﬁcations. One study found that the post-injury instability of the anterior crutiate ligament is due, in part, to re- modelling of the central nervous system. The remod- elling is probably due to the habitual reduction of us- age of that area (Valeriani et al.1996). As ligaments become strained and torn so the nerves supply loses a certain amount of receptors. This by itself can dam- age the peripheral nervous system and prevent it from accurately suppling the central nervous system with a real-time sensation of what happened to the joint. In any case, following an injury it is probably both the central and peripheral nervous systems that are damaged and so supply corrupted sensory input to the central nervous system."}

One author’s hypothesis is that some cases of back pain, for example, may originate from chronic ligamentous tension, which sends a corrupt sensory message to spinal muscles to contract continuously, causing those muscle to be in chronic tension and fatigue (Panjabi 2007). Physiology Ligaments have similar mechanical properties to other connective tissues: viscoelasticity and stress- strain (Norking and Levangie 2005). The ﬁrst mechanical property of a ligament is its non-linear stress-strain relationship (see Figure 6.3). The stress-strain graph (Figure 6.3) demonstrates three regions: 1. Toe region - this is where the deformity (liga- ment length) is high while the force applied is low. Anatomically, this is where the ﬁbrils’ crimps slack begins to tighten. The toe region is where most ligaments are at rest.2. Linear region - this is where a stress build up creates a linear build up of strain or stretch to the ligament."}

Viscoelasticity is a tendency of the tissue to stretch and return slowly to its normal form whilst dampening the shearing force. There are three viscoelasticity tissue behaviours: creep, stress- relaxation and hysteresis. Creep is the tendency of slowly increasing the ligament’s deformation under a load and the return to normal shape once the load is taken away (Fig- ure 6.4). For example, under a load the ligament will slowly elongate, and then return to its original length once the load is taken away. The rate of creep increases at high temperature. The second viscoelasticity property is stress relax- ation (Figure 6.5). This means that under a constant Time B Constant Deformation Stress Relaxation Stress Deformation Figure 6.5 Stress relaxation relationship in ligaments. Reprinted from Mow, V. C. and Hayes, W.

The third viscoelastistic property is hysteresis (Figure 6.6). Under load, ligaments undergo deformation that does not immediately return to the original length after unloading the joint. The difference between the length before loading and after unloading represents the amount of energy lost in the process. If, for example, the joint is loaded and unloaded many times, the stress-strain curve would move to the right, showing an increase strain to the same stress. Figure 6.6 illustrates how loading a ligament many times in a short period can cause a strain or a tear if there is not enough recovery time between the cycles. Normal changes to ligament through life Ligaments exhibit adaptation to external and internal changes. The effect of exercise and long-term immobility to ligaments are known and directly relate to the property of collagen ﬁbrils to increase its thickness in response to exercise and reduce thickness in response to immobility (Kannus et al.1992).

The knee crutiate ligaments express the sex hor- mone receptors for oestrogen, testosterone and re- laxin (Faryniarz et al.2006). There is an increased risk of ACL strain during the pre-ovulation stages of menstrual cycle, where hormone levels change from a low to high level (Slauterbeck et al.2002). Due to different individual hormonal proﬁles during menstrual cycle there is a signiﬁcant difference to the amount of ligamentous laxity and risk of injury (Shultz et al.2006). In the elderly there is an increase in joint capsule and ligaments laxity, which may be one of the rea- sons for the increase in incidents of osteoarthritis (Rudolph et al.2007)."}
{"id": "1022", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Pathology Pathological changes in ligaments may occur due to structural and functional failure. Any strain to a ligament may cause a long-term joint instability. There are agreed degrees of ligaments strain: 1st degree is mild, 2nd degree moderate and 3rd degree is a complete tear (Chen et al.2008). Following a strain, ligaments do not heal by pro- ducing an identical tissue; instead, a scar tissue is formed. The scar tissue presents with an uneven ma- trix, smaller in diameter collagen ﬁbers, weaker col- lagen crosslinking and a limited creep (Figure 6.7). The blood circulation is also affected with a long- term reduction in blood circulation to the scar tissue (Bray et al.1996). Although scar tissue is formed rel- atively fast, there are still mechanical and chemical changes months and years after the injury, though it never has a normal appearanceor function again, re- sulting in a high level of reoccurrences (Frank et al.1999)."}

The viewpoints of the main two treat- ments are the immobility, long rest and braces versus the sooner-than-later active treatment (see below).

Immobility affects the ligament on a cellular level with the ﬁbroblasts appearing uneven. For grades I–II a non-operative active treatment approach is the most common (Chen et al.2008) and usually comprises rest (for a limited period), ice, compression and elevation (RICE), isometric and isotonic exercises and proprioceptive training. The rationale of using the RICE treatment is to reduce the inﬂammation during the acute phase. Proprioceptive training concentrates mostly on the lower limb, in particularly post sprain in the ankle joint. The idea behind it is to maintain the propri- oceptive neural function by continuously using the joint in a challenged position. It has been found that even the use of unsupervised, home proprioceptive exercises reduces the rate of reoccurance in atheletes (Hupperets et al."}
{"id": "1026", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2009). Another treatment method is exercise, which aims to improve the proprioceptive property of the dam- aged ligament and to strengthen the muscles sur- rounding the affected joint (Olsen et al.2005). Examples of ligament injuries Lateral ankle sprain The ankle joint is one of the most common sites of ligament injury with a higher reoccurrence rate compared to other ligament strains (Hubbard and Hicks-Little 2008). It occupies 0.6% of all cases in Accident and Emergency in the U. K., with higher rate of 1.3% in young girls (Bridgman et al.2003). At 14%, ankle sprains are the most common acute sports injury (Fong et al.2009) with 59% of reoccurrence (Yeung et al.,1994). The most common ligamentous injury is to the lateral ankle, and to the anterior taloﬁbular ligament in particular (Daniel et al."}
{"id": "1027", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2009). The anterior taloﬁbular ligament is the weakest ankle joint ligament while limiting a relatively large inversion at the subtar joint (Attarian et al.1985). Lateral ankle injury happens mostly by an exces- sive supination due to mechanical and/or functional instability. Mechanical instability can arise due to certain muscular weaknesses, knee or other joint problems, or degenerative changes. Functional in- stability can arise from a lack of proprioception or coordination (Hertel 2002). Increased factors for sprain injuries are previous sprains, wearing shoes with air cells, being over- weight, not stretching before sports activities, in- creased foot width and weak active eversion and dorsiﬂexion (Daniel et al.2009). Immobilisation of the sprained joint was found to be less effective than active treatment (Kerkhoffs et al.2001)."}
{"id": "1028", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The most common treatment for grade I and II during an acute sprained ankle is RICE (Cooke et al.2003). Early exercise, which includes dorsiﬂexion and plantarﬂexion range-of-motion exercises, and isometric and isotonic strength-training exercises are recommended by many authors (Trevino et al.1994; Lynch and Renstrom 1999; Safran et al.1999). Another treatment is balanced and coordina- tion training performed on the wobble board, both as a treatment and preventative measurements (Mattacola and Dwyer 2002). It appears to halve the reoccurrence of a sprained ankle ligament. This ex- ercise enhances the proprioceptive neural function of the central nervous system and reduce the response time of the peroneal and other muscles around the ankle joint to protect the ligaments from reinjury (McKeon and Hertel 2008). A meta-analysis found that for grade III sprain ankle the possibility of surgical ligament reconstruc- tion is controversial (Lynch and Renstrom 1999). This research found that only late ligament recon- struction appears to be better than a conservative treatment after all other treatment modalities fail to produce joint stability."}

This chapter provides an overview of the skeleton and its component parts. Special attention is paid to the pro- cess of bone formation or ossiﬁcation and its unique implications for healing following skeletal injuries. The chapter further considers principles of rehabil- itation in relation to skeletal injury and pathology. The use of annotated diagrams and schema, within the chapter, further emphasise important processes in skeletal organisation (Figure 7.1). The skeleton can be divided into two subgroups: 1. Axial skeleton – bones of the skull, vertebral col- umn, ribs and sternum 2. Appendicular skeleton – bones of the upper and lower limbs. Bone is a living, well-organised, vascular form of connective tissue. It is largely composed of an or- ganic protein, collagen, and an inorganic mineral, hydroxyapatite, which combine to provide a me- chanical and supportive role in the body (Smith et al."}

The capacity of bone to adapt its structure to imposed loads has become known as Wolff’s Law: Wolff’s law: “states that bone responds to the stresses that are imposed upon it by rearranging its initial architecture in the best way to with- stand stress (Porter 2008) Bones function as: r Protectors of vital organs – provides mechanical protection for most of the body’s internal organs, thereby reducing the risk of injury to them r Supportive structures – the skeleton is the frame- work of the body it provides attachment for skele- tal muscles r Levers – the skeleton assists with movement r Reservoirs for calcium and phosphorus – storage for minerals (calcium and phosphorus), which are released when needed into the blood r Blood producing cells – develops red blood cells in the bone marrow.

Bone structure There are primarily three types of bone, namely: woven, compact and cancellous (Figure 7.2). Woven bone Woven bone is normally remodelled and replaced with either compact or cancellous bone. Woven bone is found during embryonic development, during frac- ture healing (callus formation), and in some patho- logical states, such as hyperparathyroidism and Pad- get Disease (Recker et al.1992). Compact bone Compact bone is the outer structure and provides mechanical strength, while cancellous bone forms the inner structure and its function is the metabolic unit of the bone (Figure 7.3). Compact bone is dense bone and surrounds the cancellous bone. The primary structural unit of compact bone is an osteon, which is also known as a Haversian system. Osteons consist of cylindrical shaped lamellar bone that surrounds longitudinally oriented vascular channels called Haverisan canals; horizontally"}

Cancellous bone Cancellous (spongy) bone consists of spicules of bone enclosing cavities containing marrow (blood- forming cells). This type of bone is strong but the spaces make it light and ﬂexible. Cancellous bone is always covered and therefore protected by compact bone. In long bones, cancellous bone is found in the epiphysis (at the end of the long bone); in some it also extends down inside into the shaft. In all other bones, it forms the central mass of bone within a compact bone lining. In adults, 80% of the skeleton is compact bone. However, the relative proportions of compact and cancellous bone vary in different parts of the skele- ton. For example, in the lumbar spine, cancellous bone accounts for about 70% of the total bone tissue, whereas in the femoral neck and radial diaphysis, it accounts for about 50% and 5%, respectively (Kanis 1994; Einhorn 1996; Fleisch 1997)."}

Osteocytes originate from osteoblasts em- bedded in the organic bone matrix, which subse- quently become mineralised. They have numerous cell processes forming a network of thin canaliculi that connects them with active osteoblasts and ﬂat lining cells. Osteocytes probably play a role in the homeostasis of this extracellular ﬂuid and in the lo- cal activation of bone formation and/or resorption in response to mechanical loads (Nijweide et al.1996). Osteoclasts are giant cells containing 4–20 nuclei that reabsorb bone. Osteoclastic reabsorption takes place at the cell/bone interface in a sealed-off microenvironment (Baron 1996; Teitelbaum et al.,1996). The mechanism of bone resorption involves the secretion of hydrogen ions and proteolytic enzymes into the sub-osteoclastic resorbing com- partment."}

Common skeletal injuries and their manifestation As previously stated bone provides structural support and protection, facilitating movement and mineral storage. Therefore, injuries to bone can compromise any of these functions and interrupt daily functions. Bone fractures Fractures are potentially serious injuries, damaging not only the bone but also the soft tissue in the sur- rounding area (diagram of types of fractures are illus- trated in Figure 7.4) (Table 7.3). Although the bone tissue itself contains no nociceptors, bone fracture can be very painful, due to (1) the breaking in the continuity of the periosteum; (2) oedema of nearby soft tissues, caused by bleeding of torn periosteal blood vessels, evoking pressure pain; and (3) spasms in muscles trying to hold bone fragments in place. The severity of a fracture depends on its location and the damage done to the bone and tissue near it. Serious fractures can have dangerous complica- tions if not treated promptly; possible complications include damage to blood vessels or nerves and in- fection of the bone (osteomyelitis) or surrounding tissue. Clinical features of a fracture The features of a fracture are many and varied, de- pending on the cause and nature of the injury. The clinical features are listed below: r pain r deformity r oedema r muscle spasm r abnormal movements r loss of function r shock r limitation of joint movement. Stress fractures Stress related bone injuries have become common- place amongst the members of our increasingly ac- tive society and account for up to 10% of cases in a typical sport medicine practice (Jones et al."}

These fractures occur in weight-bearing and non-weight bearing bones. There are two gen- eral types of stress fractures, insufﬁciency fracture and a fatigue fracture. Insufﬁciency fracture results from normal stress applied to abnormal bone (Pentecost et al.1964) that is weakened by an underlying disorder such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteomalacia or Paget’s disease (Stafford et al.1986) Fatigue fractures occur when normal bones are subjected to increased loads and repetitive stresses.

This is supported by the fact that stress fractures occur in both weight-bearing and non-weight bearing bones.r Muscle actions ◦Muscles may provide enough repetitive force to create a stress fracture.

Osteopenia is when the Bone mineral density (BMD) is lower than normal but not low enough to be classed as osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is an established and well-deﬁned disease that affects more than 75 million people in Europe, Japan and the USA, and causes more than 2.3 million fractures annually in Europe and the USA alone (WHO 2000). It is a systemic skele- tal disease characterised by low bone density and micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue with a consequent increase in bone fragility (WHO 2000). Early osteoporosis is not usually diagnosed and re- mains asymptomatic; it does not become clinically evident until fractures occur. Loss of bone density occurs with advancing age and rates of fracture in- crease markedly with age, giving rise to signiﬁcant morbidity and some mortality (WHO 1994). Osteoporosis is three times more common in women than in men, partly because women have a lower peak bone mass and partly because of the hormonal changes that occur at the menopause."}

According to the WHO diagnostic criteria, women with bone density levels more than 2.5 standard de- viations below the young adult reference mean are considered to have osteoporosis (Kanis et al.1994). Individuals with bone density below this threshold who also sustain a fracture meet the deﬁnition of “established or severe osteoporosis”.

The daily recommended allowance of cal- cium intake is 800–1200 mg (Thatcher et al.2009). Multiple factors can affect the bioactivity of calcium: r high-fat or high ﬁbre diets can interfere with or decrease the activity of calcium r large doses of zinc supplementation or mega doses of vitamin A can lower calcium bioactivity r high protein diets can decrease calcium reserves by increasing urinary excretion of calcium (Placzek and Boyce 2006) In addition, alcohol consumption can decrease the absorption of calcium and various medications (hep- arin, glucocorticoids) can affect calcium activity. Vi- tamin D regulates calcium absorption and excretion, especially when calcium intake is low. When calcium levels in the blood drop, parathy- roid hormone (PTH) is released. PTH causes calcium to be released from the bones; this then raises the low calcium levels in the blood. Osteoporosis may result from chronically high levels of PTH (Groff and Gropper 2000).

The chapter also reviews some common nerve injuries, their assessment and evidence based treatment. Anatomy of nerves The nervous system comprises of the central, autonomic and peripheral nervous systems (Gallant 1998) the latter of which consists of cranial nerves, spinal nerves, peripheral nerves and peripheral com- ponents of the autonomic nervous system (Gardner and Bunge 1984). The neurone is the structural unit of the nervous system and is responsible for conducting messages from one part of the body to another (Marieb 1998). The basic unit of the neurone is the axon, more commonly known as the nerve ﬁbre (Butler 1991) (Figure 8.1) and can be either mylenated or non-mylenated. Mylenated axons are surrounded by a myelin sheath and have one Schwann cell per axon. The Schwann cell is fre- quently interrupted by nodes of Ranvier; a structure that allows impulses to be conducted from one node to the next (Topp and Boyd 2006; Campbell 2008). Non-mylenated ﬁbres however, have several axons associated with only one Schwann cell (Topp and Boyd 2006; Campbell 2008). Individual mylenated ﬁbres and groups of non-mylenated ﬁbres are surrounded by three connective tissue layers; the endoneurium, the perineurium and the epineurium (Topp and Boyd, 2006; Campbell 2008). The innermost connective tissue layer is the endoneurium, which is composed of longitudi- nally aligned collagen ﬁbres and therefore, plays an important role in protecting the axon from tensile forces (Butler 1991)."}
{"id": "1082", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Encompassing the endoneurial components, axon and Schwann cells is the perineurium, the second layer of connective tissue, whose primary responsibility is to act as a primary barrier to external forces (Lundborg 1988). Collectively, all the contents surrounded by the perineurium form what is known as a nerve fascicle (Topp and Boyd 2006). Collections of nerve fascicles then form a nerve and these are surrounded by the outermost layer of connective tissue, the epineurium (Campbell 2008). The epineurium is regarded as the most resistant connective layer to tensile forces (Sunderland 1978) as it surrounds, protects and cushions the nerve fascicles (Butler 1991). Col- lectively all three connective tissue layers not only protect the axon, but are also structurally developed to cope with the tensile stresses and compressive forces nerves typically have to endure (Butler 1991). In everyday movements and postures, nerves are subjected to various mechanical stresses (Topp and Boyd 2006), which can elongate, compress or increase strain within the nerve (Shacklock 1995).

The ability of the nervous system to withstand and adapt to the mechanical stresses placed on it, is essential to prevent injury (Shacklock 1995). Alter- ations in the physical stress to which a biological tis- sue is subjected, causes predictable responses within the tissue according to Mueller and Maluf’s (2002) Physical Stress Theory. Injury to tissues is caused by excessive physical stress via any of the following mechanisms: 1. High magnitude stress applied to the tissue for a brief duration; spinal cord injury is a typical outcome from this mechanism of injury.2. Low magnitude stress applied for long duration or repetitively; an example of nerve injury from this particular mechanism of injury is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome at the wrist.3. Moderate stress applied to a tissue many times. Cubital Tunnel Syndrome at the elbow, for exam- ple in a javelin thrower, whereby repetitive high load forces are exerted through the elbow and con- sequently the ulnar nerve, is an example (Mueller and Maluf 2002)."}
{"id": "1084", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Biological tissues, such as nerves, have an ideal physical stress range that they can tolerate to main- tain homeostasis. This is called the “maintenance stress range” (Mueller and Maluf 2002). Stress lev- els lower than the maintenance range decreases a tis- sue’s tolerance to physical stress; for example during immobilisation of a limb, muscle atrophy is a typical bi-product of being in a cast for a prolonged period of time. Contrastingly, when physical stresses are ex- ceedingly higher than the homeostatic stress range, the associated tissues are unable to tolerate these and any subsequent stresses and ultimately become injured (Mueller and Maluf 2002). The mechanical stresses a nerve is subjected to are not the only factor which must be taken into account with nerve injury as the nature of the surrounding structures a nerve traverses or passes through must also be considered (Butler 1991). The nervous system is surrounded by and comes into contact with many different anatomical structures which may be ﬁrm and unyielding, such as the radial nerve in the spiral groove of the humerus, or soft, such as the tibial nerve in the posterior thigh musculature (Butler 1991). Additionally, anatomically narrow passages through which the nerve must pass may also predispose individual nerves to entrapment neuropathies, such as the ulnar nerve in the cubital fossa of the elbow (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006). The extent of an injury to a nerve is dependant on the mechanism of injury, as traumatic injuries, such as a gun-shot wound (i.e. high magnitude stress), will signiﬁcantly damage a nerve’s integrity, whilst a low magnitude stress, such as prolonged intermittent compression over a long duration of time, will have less of an impact on the nerve. Nerve injuries were initially classiﬁed by Seddon (1943) based on the severity of the injury and the potential for reversibility of the condition (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006). Classification of nerve injury Neurapraxia, axonotmesis and neurotmesis are the three categories of nerve injuries classiﬁed by Seddon (1943) each describing different degrees of injury to the nerve’s anatomical structures (Table 8.1)."}

Consequently, the clinical presentation is that of motor loss, with little sensory involvement and little disturbance of sympathetic innervation (Perlmutter and Apruzzese 1998). With remylena- tion of the nerve, motor and sensory dysfunction will gradually be restored, usually within 12 weeks (Novak and Mackinnon 2005; Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006). The prognosis for neuropraxia is excellent (Perlmutter and Apruzzese 1998) and complete recovery is expected (Novak and Mackinnon 2005). When there is loss of continuity of the axon and myelin sheath, but the majority of the connective tissue structure is maintained, the injury is classiﬁed as axonotmesis; the second classiﬁcation (Seddon 1943). The endoneurium and Schwann sheath are preserved, but injury to the axon is evident, accompanied with secondary Wallerian degenera- tion (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006). A clinical ﬁnding of signiﬁcant loss of motor, sensory and autonomic function distal to the injury site is evident (Perlmutter and Apruzzese 1998). Neural regen- eration will occur, but at a rate of approximately 1mm per day and over-all the prognosis for recovery is good (Novak and Mackinnon 2005). Stinger Syn- drome is also an example of axontmesis, particularly should the injury recur within a short period of time."}
{"id": "1087", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The most severe peripheral nerve injury is referred to as neurontmesis and involves complete disruption of the nerve trunk and connective tissue (axons, endoneurial tube, Schwann sheath and epineurium) (Campbell 2008). The prognosis for recovery is poor as there is no potential for nerve regeneration (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006) and therefore surgical intervention is often required in an attempt to re-establish the continuity of the peripheral nerve (Perlmutter and Apruzzese 1998). Avulsion of the nerve, via stab wounds or gunshot, is a typical example of neurontmesis; it is a rare occurrence in sport. The majority of nerve injuries in sport will typi- cally involve neurapraxia or axontmesis and there- fore prognosis for recovery is generally good. Assessment of nerve injury Neural and non-neural tissues should be assessed by the clinician in all patients presenting with pain (Nee and Butler 2006) by means of a comprehensive subjective and physical examination. All the phys- ical examination ﬁndings should complement and support the information obtained from the patient via subjective examination (Hall and Elvey 1999). Nee and Butler (2006) proposed numerous clinical features that may be evident in the subjective and physical assessment of patients presenting with peripheral neuropathic pain, such as complaints of tingling, burning and parasthesia in addition to antalgic postures and movement impairments being present. Motor or sensory losses, or both, may also be evident in the assessment of patients presenting with nerve pain. However, when nerve injury is suspected, the assessment of the integrity of the nerve is vital. Evaluation of the function of the muscles inner- vated by the injured nerve should be assessed via manual resistance testing to determine the motor function of the nerve (Figure 8.2 and Table 8.2)."}

Knowl- edge of the myotomes and dermatomes of the upper and lower extremities is important to conduct a thor- ough assessment of the peripheral nervous system. Nee and Butler (2006) also recommend incorporat- ing neurodynamic tests into the physical assessment to determine the mechanosensitivity of the nervous system. Neurodynamic testing Nerves slide and stretch during limb movements to allow for changes in nerve bed length (Babbage et al.2007) and whilst healthy nerves can tolerate strain and compression, injured or inﬂamed nerves become sensitive to mechanical stimuli and can inﬂict pain on movement (Bove et al.2005). Neurodynamic tests were developed to evaluate peripheral nerve sensitivity to movement and to infer underlying pathomechanics (Topp and Boyd 2006). To determine if neural tissues contribute to the pa- tient’s symptoms, it is important to move the neural Table 8.2 Myotomes of the upper and lower limb Myotomes of the Upper limb Nerve root/nerve C1 Cervical ﬂexion C2 Cervical ﬂexion C3 Cervical lateral ﬂexion C4 Shoulder elevation C5 Shoulder abduction C6 Elbow ﬂexion C7 Elbow extension C8 Thumb extension T1 Finger abduction Myotomes of the Lower limb Nerve root/nerve L1 Hip ﬂexion L2 Hip adduction L3 Knee extension L4 Ankle dorsi-ﬂexion L5 Great toe extension S1 Ankle plantar ﬂexion S2 Knee ﬂexion structure in the area in question, without moving the musculoskeletal tissues in the same region; a task attempted by structural differentiation during neuro- dynamic tests (Shacklock 1995).

Three tests for the upper limb are described below, each focused on examining the integrity of the three primary nerves in the upper extremity; the median, radial and ul- nar nerves. For the lower limb, the slump test and straight leg raise tests will be illustrated. In-depth and more detailed clinical neurodynamic tests have been presented by Shacklock (2005). Upper limb neurodynamic test with median nerve bias In patients presenting with suspected median nerve pathology whereby symptoms may be localised to the median nerve, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or pronator tunnel syndrome, incorporating a neurody- namic test into the physical examination is essential to determine if the nerve contributes to patient symp- toms. To conduct this test, the patient lies supine on the plinth with arms relaxed by the side of the body."}

The clinician then holds the pa- tient’s ipsilateral hand and places the glenohumeral joint in 90◦abduction and 90◦lateral rotation, the forearm in full supination and the wrist in exten- sion. The clinician then supports the patient’s arm on their thigh with the aim of preventing adduction of the shoulder during the test. Once in this posi- tion, the clinician slowly extends the elbow to either onset of resistance or pain (Figure 8.4). To struc- turally differentiate, the clinician can either ask the patient to execute contralateral side ﬂexion of the head for distal symptoms or the wrist can be moved from extension into ﬂexion for proximal symptoms (Shacklock 2005). Upper limb neurodynamic test with radial nerve bias In patients presenting with radial neuropathy such as radial tunnel syndrome, the clinician requires a phys- ical test which can be conducted to determine the sensitivity of the nerve to stretch. To do this, a clinical test was developed to focus speciﬁcally on the radial nerve and is conducted as follows: the patient lies supine with arms resting by the side of the body but in a diagonal direction across the plinth. This allows the clinician to apply shoulder depression using the ante- rior aspect of their hip whilst conducting the test. The patient’s starting position involves placing the elbow Figure 8.4 Upper limb neurodynamic test with median nerve bias. Figure 8.5 Upper limb neurodynamic test with radial nerve bias."}

Finally, glenohumeral abduction is ap- plied and again the clinician ceases the movement at the point of resistance or pain (Figure 8.5). To struc- turally differentiate, shoulder depression can be re- moved for distal symptoms, whilst moving the wrist from ﬂexion to neutral may identify proximal lesions (Shacklock 2005). Upper limb neurodynamic test with ulnar nerve bias When symptoms are evident in the anatomical pathway of the ulnar nerve or the lower trunk of the brachial nerve (Shacklock 2005), neurodynamic testing speciﬁc to this nerve is important. The testing sequence for an upper limb neurodynamic test with ulnar nerve bias requires the patient to lie supine on the plinth, with the head in a neutral position and the arms relaxed by the side of the body. The clinician prepares for depression of the shoulder as for the median nerve test. The patient’s shoulder joint is abducted slightly whilst the elbow is maintained in extension and the forearm slightly pronated. The wrist and hand of the patient remains in a neutral position, following which, the clinician then com- mences the test by depressing the shoulder before applying extension to the wrist and ﬁngers and pronation to the forearm.

The clinician again uses a leg to support the moving limb; thereby making the movement more ﬂuid. Again once resistance or pain is experienced by the clinician or patient respectively, shoulder abduction ceases and the structural differentiation manoeuvre is applied; either contralateral cervical side ﬂexion for distal symptoms or radial deviation for proximal symptoms (Shacklock 2005). Lower limb neurodynamic test: The slump test The slump test is used to evaluate the dynamics of the central and peripheral nervous systems from the head, along the spinal cord and sciatic nerve tract and its extensions in the foot (Shacklock 2005). The slump test should be a component of the clinical examination in patients who present with spinal symptoms (Butler 1991) and/or spinal, pelvic and lower limb conditions whereby pain is experienced in the neural distribution of the sciatic nerve and its extensions (Butler 1991; Shacklock 2005). To conduct the slump test, the patient is requested to side on the plinth with the back of the knees to the edge of the plinth and to “sag” the upper body, or bring their shoulder towards their hips, thereby re- sulting in thoracic ﬂexion. The clinician then applies overpressure at C7 spinous process with the medial aspect of the forearm (Figure 8.7). The patient is instructed to bring their chin to chest, following Figure 8.7 Lower limb neurodynamic test: The slump test.which the clinician applies dorsi-ﬂexion to the ankle before slowly extending the knee to the point of resistance or pain."}

Lower limb neurodynamic test: the straight leg raise The straight leg raise (SLR) is a similar neurody- namic test to the slump test, intent in evaluating the integrity of the lumbosacral trunk and plexus, sciatic nerve and its expansion in the leg and foot (Shacklock 2005). The format for the SLR is as fol- lows: the patient lies supine on the plinth with arms resting by the side of the body. The clinician uses one hand to support the posterior calf, just proximal to the ankle joint; whilst the other hand is placed on the anterior aspect of the knee joint to ensure knee ex- tension is maintained throughout. Maintaining this position, the clinician then begins to lift the leg off the bed, thereby conducting hip ﬂexion, moving to the point of resistance or patient pain. Following this the clinician then applies dorsi-ﬂexion to the ankle by way of structurally differentiating (Figure 8.8). An increase in symptoms at this point indicates a neural involvement in the patient’s condition.

Neurodynamic tests as treatment tools A positive neurodynamic test is constituted by a reproduction or increase in symptoms during the test, which is subsequently decreased with the re- moval of the structural differentiating manoeuvre (Maitland 1985); difference in responses between limbs (Nee and Butler 2006); differences in avail- able range of motion (Coppieters et al.2002; Nee and Butler 2006); or where there is structural dif- ferentiation supporting a neurogenic source (Butler 2000). Whilst all the aforementioned tests have been described from a diagnostic point of view, each of these can be modiﬁed and incorporated into treat- ment plans, should their inclusion as a treatment modality be warranted. Modiﬁed versions of the neu- rodynamic tests can be used in clinical practice in the treatment plan for peripheral nerve injuries and can be speciﬁc to each patient. The purpose of utilising neurodynamic tests as treatment tools is to minimise scarring and stretching of the nerve, and maintain or restore normal nerve excursion and function (Wehb´e and Schlegel 2004). Two neural treatment techniques will be con- sidered in this chapter; sliding and tensioning techniques, the principle of which can be applied to any neurodynamic test and considered for use in the treatment plan for neuropathy patients. A “sliding” technique was deﬁned by Coppieters et al. (2009), as a combination of movements that elongate the nerve bed at one joint, whilst simultaneously reducing nerve bed length at an adjacent joint, to Figure 8.9 Sliding technique.counterbalance the elongation."}

The opposing technique is the “tensioning” technique, which the same authors deﬁne as the elongation of the nerve bed at two adjacent joints (Coppieters et al.2009) and again, referring back to the median nerve test, would involve the patient actively extending the elbow whilst simultaneously side ﬂexing the cervical spine into the contralateral direction (Figure 8.10).

{"id": "1098", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "TREATMENT PLANS FOR NERVE INJURY 127 The sliding technique causes more longitudinal excursion of a nerve than the tensioning technique (Coppieters et al.2009), and therefore, from a clinical viewpoint, may be more suitable for highly irritable or acute neural conditions as it still encourages movement of the inﬂamed nerve, whilst limiting the strain placed on the nerve. A tensioning technique, however, is proposed to induce higher tension within the nerve and therefore less excursion (Coppieters et al.2009) than a sliding technique and can therefore be considered more aggressive and possibly suitable for less irritable conditions. The clinician should therefore consider the imple- mentation of sliding or tensioning techniques into a treatment plan for the patient presenting with neural symptoms, with the former to be used in acute, irritable conditions and the latter technique for use in the end stage of rehabilitation. Ultimately, neurodynamic tests can be modiﬁed and used in the treatment plan for the neuropathic pa- tient and can also be incorporated into a home exer- cise programme (Kostopoulos 2004). Typical patient responses to neurodynamic tests as both a diagnos- tic and treatment tool, of which the patient should be aware, range from reporting feelings of “stretching”, tissue tension, light numbness or a slight increase of pain during the technique; all which should re- duce or dissipate on cessation of the test or treatment (Kostopoulos 2004). Treatment plans for nerve injury Immediately post-injury, inﬂammation occurs, thereby rendering injured tissues less capable of tolerating stress compared to their pre-morbid level (Mueller and Maluf 2002). Nerve ﬁbres become sensitive to stretch and low intensity pressure following injury (Dilley et al.2005)."}
{"id": "1099", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Therefore the importance of protecting the tissues during this acute inﬂammation stage from subsequent stress cannot be underestimated (Mueller and Maluf 2002). Conservative treatment is the initial recommended strategy in numerous neuropathies not requiring urgent medical attention. Within this category of treatment, several authors suggest incorporating non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ice, rest, elimination of the aggravating activity, physical and manual therapy into the conservative treatment plan (McKean 2009; Shapiro and Preston 2009); the primary aim of which is to decrease inﬂammation and restore nerve function. Brief treatment options will be provided in this section, following the discussion of each speciﬁc injury. Peripheral nerve injury Neurological conditions are common in athletes (Dimberg and Burns 2005) often dependant on the nature and intensity of the sporting activity (Toth 2009). A clinician may be confronted with signs and symptoms of neurological injuries affecting various aspects of the nervous system, such as spinal nerve roots, peripheral nerve injuries or plexopathies. Pos- sessing the ability to recognise and diagnose injuries speciﬁc to sporting activities and then subsequently to treat the injury, is vital to a clinician in sport (Toth 2009) to ensure a rapid return to play for the athlete. The upper extremity is particularly vulnerable to nerve injury (Dahlin 2008) due to its high mobility (Aldridge et al.2001) and it is therefore unsurpris- ing that the brachial plexus is the most commonly injured plexus in the body (Wilbourn 2007). The brachial plexus is formed by the ventral rami of the spinal nerves C5 to T1, which enter the posterior cervical triangle between the scalene anterior and medius muscles (Pratt 2005)."}
{"id": "1100", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Superior, middle and inferior nerve trunks of the brachial plexus are then formed by the C5–C6, C7 and C8–T1 nerve roots re- spectively (Reid and Trent 2002; Pratt, 2005). These trunks divide into anterior and posterior portions be- hind the clavicle whereby these divisions then unite to form lateral, medial and posterior cords which en- ter the axilla (Reid and Trent 2002). The end result of the brachial plexus is the formation of periph- eral nerves which supply the upper limb (Pratt 2005) (Figure 8.11). The primary peripheral nerves which are subsequently discussed in this chapter are the axillary nerve, long thoracic nerve, suprascapular nerve, ulnar nerve, median nerve and radial nerve; the anatomical locations of which can be viewed in Figure 8.12.

The superior trunk of the brachial plexus (C5 and C6) is thought to be the structure injured in this syndrome (Aldridge et al.2001; Dimberg and Burns 2005; Wilbourn 2007). Tensile overload is one mechanism of injury for the brachial plexus (Hershman 1990), whereby the head and shoulder of the symptomatic side have been forced in opposite directions to each other (Weinstein 1998; Dimberg and Burns 2005) thereby causing stretch and traction of the nerve. Alternatively, another mechanism of injury in Stinger Syndrome is where a compressive force forces the head and neck into the posterolateral corner, causing nerve root compression and thereby injuring the nerve (Weinstein 1998).

Symptoms reported for Stinger Syndrome gen- erally involve a single upper extremity (Dimberg and Burns 2005; Wilbourn 2007) with sharp, burn- ing pain and numbness accompanied by short-lived weakness down the arm (Weinstein 1998; Aldridge et al.2001). Patients who report bilateral or lower extremity symptoms should be treated with caution as spinal cord injury is a potential injury (Dimberg and Burns 2005). An important ﬁnding with Stinger Syndrome is that symptoms are unilateral (Wilbourn 2007) and short-lived. Neuropraxia and axontmesis are typically associated with this type of injury. If the symptoms resolve within minutes and there is no evidence of reduced strength or disrupted move- ment of the neck, the athlete can be considered for return to play in the same competition (Dimberg and Burns 2005). However, the player should be contin- uously monitored during the remainder of the com- petition and re-assessed over the subsequent weeks. Cervical spine rehabilitation should be undertaken in the Stinger Syndrome patient, aiming to protect the injured structures and control pain and inﬂam- mation in the initial stages, following which ﬂexi- bility and strength imbalances and deﬁcits should be addressed (Weinstein 1998). Postural abnormalities should also be considered over the course of treat- ing patients with cervical spine and nerve injuries."}
{"id": "1103", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "A treatment strategy for Stinger Syndrome can in- clude NSAIDs, modiﬁcation of activity, neurody- namic sliding techniques in the acute stage, manual therapy of the cervical spine, range of movement activities for the shoulder and strengthening of the shoulder and neck muscles. Thoracic outlet syndrome The thoracic outlet region in the upper extremity contains three structures; the subclavian artery, subclavian vein and the brachial plexus, all of which pass under the clavicle and subclavius muscle, before then travelling beneath the pectoralis minor muscle close to its insertion point at the coracoid process, whereafter, the structures enter the axilla space (Atasoy 2004). These neurovascular structures pass through the interscalene triangle; comprising of the anterior and middle scalene muscles and the ﬁrst rib, whilst en-route to the axilla (Brantigan and Roos 2004) and are considered vulnerable to com- pression within this area. Restriction of space for the neurovascular structures to pass through within the thoracic outlet can cause compression of the neural and/or vascular structures, subsequently resulting in symptoms (Crosby and Wehb´e 2004). Compression of one or more of the structures can lead to the diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). The clinical presentation of TOS can be variable, presenting as either a neurological or a vascular con- dition, or both. However, with Brantigan and Roos (2004) reporting 98% of cases to be neurological in origin and Crosby and Wehb´e (2004) agreeing that the majority of patients have neurogenic symptoms, for the purpose of this section, TOS will be discussed in relation to the brachial plexus only. TOS can develop insidiously, or as a consequence of a previous traumatic injury, such as whiplash or a similar such trauma, which ultimately causes chronic muscle spasm within the neck or shoulder (Brantigan and Roos 2004). Whilst the initial injury may be considered to be relatively minor, the resul- tant effect of the injury on the brachial plexus may be delayed and the condition may take considerable time to develop. The patient may complain of arm elevation exacerbating symptoms, such as shoulder press or serving in tennis, whilst exercise can in- duce a similar response, but only following cessation of the exercise, rather than during it (Brantigan and Roos 2004)."}

Branti- gan and Roos (2004) recommend incorporating the EAST (elevated arm stress test) into the clinical ex- amination to diagnose TOS as few individuals with this condition are actually able to complete the test. In the majority of cases, conservative treatment will alleviate symptoms and address the cause of TOS unless there is signiﬁcant neural loss or vascular compression (Crosby and Wehb´e 2004). Incorporation of NSAIDs, postural control including during sleep, manual therapy such as thoracic and ﬁrst rib mobilisation and muscle and nerve gliding exercises into the treatment plan should be under- taken for patients with TOS (Crosby and Wehb´e"}

Exercise therapy such as neck side ﬂexion, neck rotation, chin tucks, shoulder shrugs and shoulder circles to name but a few, can also be ben- eﬁcial for this condition (Crosby and Wehb´e 2004). Crosby and Wehb´e (2004) present a comprehensive overview of treatment strategies for TOS. Axillary nerve The axillary nerve is the terminal branch of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, receiving its contributions from C5 and C6 nerve roots (Bencar- dino and Rosenberg 2006). Axillary nerve injury is a well-known complication of anterior glenohumeral dislocation (Perlmutter and Apruzzese 1998; Goslin and Krivickas 1999) evident in 9–18% of this injury (Perlmutter and Apruzzese 1998). The close proximity of the anatomical course of the axillary nerve to the shoulder joint increases its susceptibility to injury, secondary to shoulder dislocation. The nerve travels inferior to the humeral head before passing through the quadrangular space, where it then wraps horizontally around the posterior aspect of the surgical neck of the humerus (Pratt 2005). It then enters the deltoid muscle which it innervates, along with teres minor (Goslin and Krivickas 1999). Glenohumeral dislocation typically occurs in an inferior-anterior direction (Owens and Itamura 2000) whereby on dislocation, the humeral head moves into the infra-articular fossa (Pratt 2005). As a consequence of the forced, abrupt movement of the humeral head, a traction force is placed on the axillary nerve (Perlmutter and Apruzzese 1998) resulting in stretching of the nerve around the humeral head and tension propagating to the infra- clavicular brachial plexus (Pratt 2005); the overall outcome resulting in nerve injury (Pratt 2005)."}
{"id": "1106", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Blunt trauma to the anterior/lateral aspect of the shoulder, typically seen in tackling during rugby, whereby a compressive force is applied to the axillary nerve is another common mechanism of injury for this structure (Perlmutter and Apruzzese 1998). Injury to the axillary nerve with shoulder dis- locations may go unnoticed initially as the bony injury may dominate the clinical picture (Perlmutter and Apruzzese 1998) and consequently for an athlete participating in contact sports, a thorough neurological examination with shoulder dislocation should be undertaken (Perlmutter and Apruzzese, 1998). A well-deﬁned patch of sensory loss over the lateral shoulder, in addition to weakness in shoulder abduction (deltoid) and external rotation (teres minor) are typical clinical reporting for axillary neuropathy (Perlmutter and Apruzzese 1998; Goslin and Krivickas 1999). Neurological complications following shoulder dislocation, of the brachial plexus and axillary nerve are enhanced in patients >50 years or if the shoulder remains dislocated for greater than 12 hours (Pratt 2005). Restoring full range of motion at the shoulder is a priority in the conservative treatment for the axillary nerve (Perlmutter and Apruzzese 1998; Goslin and Krivickas 1999. NSAIDs and analgesics will assist with pain and inﬂammation control during the acute stage. Strengthening exercises for the rotator cuff and periscapular muscles should also be undertaken (Aldridge et al.2001) in addition to nerve gliding exercises. Long thoracic nerve The long thoracic nerve arises from the ventral rami of C5–C7 spinal nerves (Goslin and Krivickas 1999) and innervates exclusively the serratus anterior mus- cle (Goslin and Krivickas 1999; Aldridge et al.2001; Pratt 2005)."}
{"id": "1107", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The relative immobility of the long thoracic nerve is a primary factor in the occurrence of injury to this structure, as it is anchored at regular, short intervals throughout it’s anatomical course (Pratt 2005), particularly at the scalene medius and serratus anterior muscles (Goslin and Krivickas 1999). Consequently, traction or stretch of the long thoracic nerve, such as with extreme excursion of the shoulder girdle, is a common mechanism of injury for this structure (Goslin and Krivickas 1999; Pratt 2005). Palsy of this nerve has been associated with repetitive motion or muscular hypertrophy in sport (Toth et al.2005). One case reported an elite marksman presenting with long thoracic neuropathy, due, according to the author, to the positional stress imposed during repetitive shooting postures whilst holding the gun (Woodhead 1985). Maintaining static postures that keep the shoulder girdle elevated for long periods is an alternate way in which injury to the long thoracic nerve occurs (Goslin and Krivickas 1999; Pratt 2005). This is evident in patients with Saturday night palsy (Pratt 2005), which originates from patients falling asleep on a chair with the shoulder draped over the back of a chair, thereby"}

Due to the relative superﬁciality of the nerve, it is also susceptible to external compression (Pratt 2005). Scapula winging is the most prevalent clinical ﬁnding associated with injury to the long thoracic nerve (Aldridge et al.2001; Goslin and Krivickas 1999) as a result of weakness of the serratus ante- rior muscle (Owens and Itamura 2002). This clinical ﬁnding is best demonstrated by having the patient perform a push-up against a wall (Owens and Ita- mura 2002). An ache or burning pain in the posterior shoulder with associated weakness in arm elevation and abduction is an early ﬁnding in patients with long thoracic nerve pathology (Owens and Itamura 2002), in addition to them having difﬁculty perform- ing overhead activities (Aldridge et al.2001), possi- bly due to serratus anterior being unable to efﬁciently laterally rotate the scapula during shoulder elevation. Treatment strategies for long thoracic neuropathy involve rest and avoidance or modiﬁcation of the aggravating activity (Goslin and Krivickas 1999), NSAIDs and physical therapy. Exercises aiming to ﬁx the scapula against the thorax are advised to pre- vent further overstretching of the nerve or scapula winging (Goslin and Krivickas 1999).

Suprascapular nerve The suprascapular nerve originates from the su- perior nerve trunk (C5–C6 nerve roots) at Erbs’ point (Aldridge et al.2001; Pratt 2005; Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006) and is responsible for inner- vating supraspinatous and infraspinatous muscles, which abduct and laterally rotate the shoulder re- spectively (Goslin and Krivickas 1999; Pratt 2005). The suprascapular nerve is vulnerable to entrapment (Goslin and Krivickas 1999) as it passes through the suprascapular foramen before curving around the spinoglenoid notch; both anatomical points of nerve entrapment (Pratt 2005). Injury to this structure can occur as a result of acute stretching, a blow to the superior aspect of the shoulder (Owens and Itamura 2001) whereby the shoulder is forcibly depressed (Goslin and Krivickas 1999), or can be of insidious onset (Aldridge et al.2001). Repetitive scapular motion, such as that which occurs during overhead activities in tennis or badminton can stretch and compress the supras- capular nerve and induce entrapment neuropathy (Bencadino and Rosenberg 2006). Patients with suprascapular neuropathy may complain of pain at the superior border of the scapula (Goslin and Krivickas 1999), which may co-exist with impinge- ment signs and symptoms (Owens and Itamura 2002) or weakness (Goslin and Krivickas 1999). Weakness and pain during shoulder abduction and lateral rotation may be evident, due to dennervation of the supraspinatous and infraspinatous muscles respectively (Goslin and Krivickas 1999; Aldridge et al.2001)."}

Restoring full range of motion at the shoulder, increasing strength of the scapular stabilisers and rotator cuff muscles (Goslin and Krivickas 1999) are additional aims for a treatment programme for this neuropathy.

The arcuate ligament and medial collateral ligament of the elbow form the roof and ﬂoor aspect of the tunnel respec- tively (Pratt 2005; Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006). During elbow ﬂexion the points of attachments for the structures of the cubital tunnel are pulled further apart, resulting in tightening of both the ﬂoor and roof of the tunnel. In addition, during forearm ﬂex- ion, the trochlea of the humerus rotates under the medial collateral ligament and elevates the ﬂoor of the tunnel, culminating in decreased space for the ul- nar nerve to glide and move (Pratt 2005). Therefore, it is unsurprising that this syndrome is prevalent in throwing athletes (Izzi et al.2001), many of whom undertake repetitive elbow joint movements, with forced extension, such as seen in pitching a baseball. During repetitive, high-velocity throwing, athletes, particularly in those who demonstrate excessive lax- ity at the elbow (Badia and Stennett; Rokito et al.1996), increased traction is placed on the nerve dur- ing the movement, all of which culminates in an increased susceptibility to ulnar neuropathy (Rokito et al.1996).

Weakness in the ﬁnger abductors, and thumb adductor or strug- gling to maintain a powerful grip may be additional clinical complaints (Izzi et al.2001; Shapiro and Pre- ston 2009). In the overhead athlete, pain along the medial joint line may be the ﬁrst clinical sign of ulnar neuropathy or complaints of a popping or snapping sensation at the elbow during ﬂexion and extension of the forearm, due to subluxation of the ulnar nerve, may also be reported (Aldridge et al.2001). In the early stages of nerve compression, provoca- tive testing may be the only positive ﬁnding (Novak and Mackinnon 2005). A positive Tinel’s sign should be performed at the entrapment site and along the course of the nerve whereby reproduction of patient symptoms in the relevant neural distribution consti- tutes a positive test. Tapping the ulnar nerve behind the medial epicondyle is a Tinel’s test for the ulnar nerve at the elbow (Salama and Stanley 2008). Po- sitional and provocation tests should also be under- taken in potential entrapment neuropathy, whereby each test is held for one minute, and are deemed pos- itive if there is alteration in sensations in the correct neural distribution (Table 8.3) (Novak and Mackin- non 2005).

A night splint may be indicated in early cases, particularly if the patient sleeps prone, with the elbow tucked under a pillow whereby local pressure can be placed on the ulnar nerve. In this position, traction can also be placed on the nerve, if the elbow remains ﬂexed and shoulder abducted during the sleeping posture (Izzi et al.2001; Salama and Stanley 2008).

Radial nerve injury can occur secondary to humeral shaft fracture, as a result of the inappropriate use of axillary crutches or due to entrapment at the elbow (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006). The radial nerve also has the potential to become entrapped in callus formation during the healing process following humeral fracture (Pratt 2005). Radial tunnel syndrome Compression of the radial nerve at the elbow is referred to as radial tunnel syndrome and more commonly affects the posterior interosseus nerve (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006). It is commonly seen in racquet sport athletes or swimmers where repetitive pronation and supination occurs (Izzi et al.2001; Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006). The poste- rior interosseus nerve is vulnerable to compression at various sites within the radial tunnel (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006), of which the arcade of Frohse is one of the hazardous anatomical structures that can compress the nerve at the elbow (Pratt 2005). The arcade of Frohse is a ﬁbrous arch formed by the proximal portion of the superﬁcial head of the supinator muscle (Pratt 2005; Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006) and under which the radial nerve passes (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006). Clinically, a patient with compression of the radial nerve at the elbow will present with poorly localised pain to the antero-lateral aspect of the elbow, which can be provoked by manoeuvers that stretch or compress the nerve (Izzi et al.2001)."}

Whilst carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common nerve entrapment of the upper extremity (Bencardio and Rosenberg 2006), it is more common in the gen- eral population as opposed to athletes, as the latter typically suffer from nerve compression at the elbow (Izzi et al.2001). Pronator teres syndrome Pronator teres syndrome is compression of the me- dian nerve (Izzi et al.2001; Kostopoulos 2004) and is the most common cause of median nerve entrapment at the elbow (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006)."}

External compression on the forearm muscles is another source of medial neuropathy dis- cussed by Badia and Stennett (2006) whereby one of the authors reported medial nerve compression in an acrobat who wrapped a curtain of material around the forearm as part of an acrobatic routine during numerous performances, thereby repetitively com- pressing the median nerve and ultimately inﬂicting injury. The clinical features of pronator teres syndrome are often vague (Kostopolous 2004). However, pa- tients with this syndrome may complain of volar arm pain, with or without hand pain, which may be exacerbated by repeated forearm pronation and wrist ﬂexion (Izzi et al.2001). Numbness in the median nerve distribution with repetitive pronation and supination, but not elbow ﬂexion and extension, is another indicator of this neuropathy (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006).

Tenderness on palpation can be evident over the pronator muscle (Izzi et al.2001). Patients with pronator teres syndrome are advised to abstain from the aggravating activity or mod- ify their choice of equipment or technique (Badia and Stennett; Salama and Stanley 2008). NSAIDs, rest (Salama and Stanley 2008), nerve gliding exer- cises and stretching of the pronator teres muscle are some of the treatment strategies available to clini- cians for this neuropathy. Splinting is another option presented by Salama and Stanley (2008) for treat- ment of this condition. Carpal tunnel syndrome Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common entrapment neuropathy in the upper body (Shapiro and Preston 2009), involving compression of the me- dian nerve as it traverses through the wrist at the carpal tunnel (Rempel and Diao 2004) and presents relatively frequent in athletes (Aldridge et al.2001). The carpal tunnel is composed of the stiff carpal bones of the wrist, which make up the ﬂoor and walls of the tunnel and the ﬂexor retinaculum, which acts as the roof of the tunnel (Kostopoulos 2004). Nine tendons, the medial nerve, synovium and radial and ulnar bursae occupy the carpal tunnel (Rempel and Diao 2004)."}
{"id": "1119", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "It is therefore quite apparent how this particular area may be subjected to entrapment neu- ropathy due to the limited space within the tunnel, and the high volume of structures occupying this space. CTS is considered to develop as the result of repet- itive wrist use and commonly presents in gripping athletes, such as archery, racquet and throwing ath- letes (Izzi et al.2001). The syndrome, according to Kostopoulos (2004) is deﬁned by the signs and symptoms of the median nerve at the wrist, as sen- sory loss and parasthesia are commonly present in the distribution of the median nerve with this condi- tion (Shapiro and Preston 2009). A thorough inves- tigation of the wrist and cervical spine should be un- dertaken to eliminate the potential for double crush syndrome (Kostopoulos 2004). Clinically, patients complain of pain in the wrist and hand with parasthe- sia evident in the lateral three and a half ﬁngers (Izzi et al.2001) in addition to reporting nocturnal pain (Aldridge et al.2001; Izzi et al.2001). In chronic conditions, symptoms may be reported above the carpal region, as far distal as the cervical spine (Kostopoulos 2004)."}

A positive Tinel’s sign or Phalens test is indicative of CTS (Aldridge et al.2001; Shapiro and Preston 2009) and thenar atrophy may be observed in advanced cases of CTS (Aldridge et al.2001). Symptoms can be exacerbated during sleep if the wrist is maintained in a ﬂexed or extended position (Shapiro and Preston 2009). Conservative treatment of CTS can include NSAIDs, active rest, modiﬁcation of the aggravat- ing activity, tendon and nerve gliding (Aldridge et al.2001; Izzi et al.2001; Kostopoulos 2004) and exercise therapy."}

Lower limb nerve injuries Comprising of the lumbar and sacral plexuses, the lumbosacral plexus originates from L1, L2, L3 and, in part, L4 anterior primary rami (APR) (Wilbourn 2007). The remaining APR of L4 fuses with L5 APR to form the lumbosacral trunk, which subsequently contributes to the formation of the sacral plexus; an entity responsible for providing sensation to the ma- jority of the lower limb (Wilbourn 2007). The lower branch of L2, all of L3 and the upper branch of L4 terminate by dividing into anterior and posterior divi- sions; the former forming the obturator nerve and the latter forming the femoral nerve. The superior and inferior gluteal nerves are formed by the posterior divisions of L4, L5 and S1, and the posterior divi- sions of L5, S1 and S2, respectively (Figure 8.13). The sacral plexus provides sensation to the gluteal re- gion and, with the exception of the anterolateral thigh and a lengthy strip of medial leg, the lower limb. It innervates the pelvic ﬂoor muscles, gluteals and tensor fascia latae, hamstrings and all the muscles of the leg and foot (Wilbourn 2007). Lumbosacral plexopathies are infrequent, compared to brachial plexus injury, possibly due in part to the protec- tive anatomical arrangement of the pelvis and sur- rounding musculature, in addition to the nerves be- ing associated with less mobile structures (Wilbourn"}

The anatomical arrangement of the sciatic, tibial and peroneal nerves can be viewed from Fig- ure 8.14 and are subsequently discussed in relation to injury and treatment, particularly in sporting pop- ulations. Sciatic nerve Originating from L4, L5, S1 and S2 nerve roots and consisting of a peroneal and tibial division, which are encased in a common sheath, the sciatic nerve is formed (Katirji 1999). The sciatic nerve exits the pelvis via the greater sciatic notch before traversing into the posterior thigh where approximately mid- thigh; it splits into the tibial nerve and common per- oneal nerve (Yuen and So 1999). The tibial nerve is responsible for innervating the majority of the ham- strings; the short head of biceps femoris being the exception as it is innervated by the common peroneal nerve (Katirji 1999; Yuen and So 1999). Piriformis syndrome The piriformis muscle originates from the anterior surface of the sacrum, inserting into the greater trochanter of the femur (Papadopoulos and Khan 2004). It traverses to its insertion, via the sciatic notch; a point where all neurovascular structures which enter the buttock from the pelvis descend, either superior or inferior to piriformis; the sciatic nerve, being one such structure, exits the pelvis be- low the muscle (Papadapoulous and Khan 2004). Piriformis syndrome arises from the belief that a hy- pertrophied piriformis muscle compresses the sciatic nerve causing pain in the nerve’s distribution (Tiel 2008), a theory which is plausible considering the intimate anatomical arrangement between these two structures. The resultant effect of this nerve com- pression is symptoms indicative of proximal sciatic nerve dysfunction, a neuropathy that has become known as piriformis syndrome (Shapiro and Preston 2009)."}
{"id": "1123", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "A patient presenting with suspected piriformis syndrome generally complains of pain and ten- derness in the buttock region at the sciatic notch, particularly during prolonged sitting on hard surfaces (Shapiro and Preston 2009). Complaints of buttock pain, with or without accompanying ipsilateral radiating pain in the sciatic nerve’s distri- bution, is common; symptoms may be exacerbated by stretching the piriformis via adduction and medial rotation of the hip joint (Papadapoulous and Khan 2004; Shapiro and Preston 2009). The clinical assessment should include a comprehensive neurological examination inclusive of motor, sensory and reﬂex tests (Papadapoulous and Khan 2004). Palpation of the sciatic notch should also be undertaken as this can reproduce symptoms (Papadapoulous and Khan 2004; Shapiro and Preston 2009). However, the intolerance to pro- longed sitting on hard surfaces is probably the most prominent sign of this condition (Papadapoulous and Khan 2004); and therefore this condition may be commonly seen in rowers. The noticeable difference between piriformis syndrome and L5 radiculopathy is the latter presents with back pain, altered reﬂexes, sensory loss and muscle weakness of the hamstrings and gastrocnemius (Shapiro and Preston 2009). Treatment options for piriformis syndrome should include NSAIDs, physical therapy, neurodynamic treatment techniques and stretching of the muscle (Papadapoulous and Khan 2004; Shapiro and Pre- ston 2009). Should conservative treatment fail, in- jection or surgical release are more advanced options according to the same authors."}

Posterior thigh injury In athletes presenting with an injury to the posterior thigh there is not automatically an injury to the hamstrings (Woods et al.2004). For example, almost 20% of Australian Football League (AFL) players had a normal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of the hamstrings, despite presenting with pain in the posterior thigh (Verrall et al.2001). The conse- quences of such ﬁndings for clinicians is such that, in a patient presenting with posterior thigh pain, where there is difﬁculty identifying by palpation the painful site, lack of bruising, a vague mechanism of injury or complaints of spinal pain, mechanosensitivity of the neural system should be suspected (Butler 1991). The nervous system may incur injury as a direct or"}

Fibrosis, lesions or intermuscular adhesions following muscle injury can reduce the ﬂuidness of movement between the muscle and the nerve, and thereby lead to secondary nerve damage (Turl and George 1998; Shacklock 2005). Consid- erable overlap in terms of clinical features exist be- tween Grade 1 or minor hamstring muscle strains and injuries involving referred pain (Verrall et al.2003). Considering that the clinical signs associated with Grade 2 and 3 muscle strains, such as swelling and bruising, are typically absent from Grade 1 strains (Kornberg and Lew 1989; Turl and George 1998), differentiation of Grade I hamstring injury from referred pain is difﬁcult (Kornberg and Lew 1989). Suspicion of sciatic nerve involvement in ham- string strains is warranted, particularly considering how one in ﬁve athletes will have an absence of muscle pathology on MRI scan (Verrall et al.2001), despite presenting clinically as a muscle strain. As an MRI scan is not an easily accessible diagnostic tool to many clinicians working in sport, neurodynamic testing, via the slump test is often the clinical test used to differentially diagnose posterior thigh pain. Whilst the treatment of posterior thigh pain, if considered to be muscular, should focus on return- ing the muscle to pre-morbid abilities, the sciatic nerve should not be ignored. Whilst slump stretch- ing, used in conjunction with traditional treatment (not mobilisation) modalities, has been shown to signiﬁcantly decrease the recovery period from ham- string injury in professional AFL players (Kornberg and Lew 1989); no research has evaluated the effect sliding or tensioning techniques has on the return to play."}
{"id": "1126", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "However, as with all the aforementioned neu- ropathies, sliding or tensioning neurodynamic tech- niques should be included in the treatment of pos- terior thigh injury; the selected technique dependant on the irritability of the patient’s condition. Slid- ing techniques should be considered in the acute stage management, progressing to the more aggres- sive tensioning techniques in the latter stages of re- habilitation. Peroneal nerve injury The common peroneal nerve (CPN) originating from the sciatic nerve, descends through the posterior thigh before traversing the popliteal fossa, whereby it then wraps around the ﬁbular neck before passing through the ﬁbular tunnel (Katirji 1999), following which the nerve divides into the superﬁcial and deep peroneal nerve (McKean 2009; Shapiro and Preston 2009). The ﬁbular tunnel is a tendinous tunnel be- tween the peroneus longus muscle and the ﬁbula (Katirji 1999) and it is therefore a common site of compression for this nerve. Peroneal neuropathy is prevalent in individuals who repetitively squat (Shapiro and Preston 2009), such as a catcher in baseball, as this position can induce prolonged stretching of the nerve. However, it also occurs in individuals with minimal body fat, due to the minimal amount of adipose tissue avail- able to surround and protect the nerve from external forces or compression (Shapiro and Preston 2009). An acute injury to the CPN may occur in runners, whereby the nerve is forcibly stretched as the result of a severe ankle inversion injury (Shapiro and Pre- ston 2009), whilst fracture to the ﬁbular head or knee dislocation can also injury this nerve (Katirji 1999). Typically patients complain of pain, burning or numbness down the anterolateral aspect of the lower leg with a loss in sensation evident in the dorsum of the foot (Katirji 1999; McKean 2009; Shapiro and Preston 2009). Clinical examination can reveal weakness in the ankle evertor muscles (McKean 2009), the ankle and toe dorsi-ﬂexors (Shapiro and Preston 2009), the resultant effect being foot-drop (Katirji 1999). As a consequence of foot-drop, sus- ceptibility to falls is increased in patients as the foot may get trapped due to the inability to dorsi-ﬂex the foot when walking (Katirji 1999)."}

Conservative treatment for non-traumatic per- oneal neuropathy should include NSAIDs, active rest, physical therapy and neurodynamic sliding or tensioning techniques, such as the SLR with plantar- ﬂexion and inversion and manual therapy. In thin athletes, padding on the ﬁbular head may be recom- mended to protect the peroneal nerve from external compressive forces. Avoidance of crossing the legs is also advised and ankle bracing should be consid- ered in patients presenting with foot-drop to prevent ankle inversion sprains (Katirji 1999; Shapiro and Preston 2009)."}
{"id": "1128", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "138 PERIPHERAL NERVE INJURIES Tibial nerve injury The tibial nerve originates from the ventral divisions of the L5, S1 and S2 nerve roots and is the largest of the two major divisions of the sciatic nerve (Oh and Meyer 1999), traversing through the popliteal fossa, entering the lower leg between the medial and lateral head of gastrocnemius (Franson and Baravarian 2006), before passing on the medial aspect of the ankle and entering the foot via the tarsal tunnel (Oh and Meyer 1999). The tarsal tunnel is a ﬁbro-osseous tunnel comprising of the ﬂexor retinaculum as the roof of the tunnel and the medial wall of the talus and calcaneus and distal medial aspect of the tibia as the ﬂoor of the tunnel (Oh and Meyer 1999; Franson and Baravarian 2006; McKean 2009). Numerous anatomical structures course through the tarsal tunnel, such as the tibialis posterior tendon, posterior tibial nerve and ﬂexor hallucis longus and ﬂexor digitorum tendons, along with numerous blood vessels (Franson and Baravarian 2006). One of the most common entrapment neuropathies of the lower limb is tarsal tunnel syndrome involving the tibial nerve (Oh and Meyer 1999). Tarsal tunnel syndrome Tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS) is a compression neuropathy of the posterior tibial nerve as it passes through the tarsal tunnel at the ankle on the medial side (Franson and Baravarian 2006). The diagnosis of TTS is based on the subjective history and objective examination of a patient (Franson and Baravarian 2006). Patients can present with numerous symptoms such as tingling, numbness or pain at the toes, through the arch of the foot or the heel. Prolonged standing or walking may exacerbate symptoms (Franson and Baravarian 2006) and therefore this is an injury that may be prevalent in hikers or runners, the latter of which may be vulnerable to TTS (Shapiro and Preston 2009) due to the repetitive ankle dorsi-ﬂexion and plantar ﬂexion which occurs whilst running (McKean 2009). An insidious onset of TTS is often reported (Shapiro and Preston 2009) and symptoms can vary depending on the location of the tibial nerve and its branches (McKean 2009). Patients may com- plain of numbness or tingling and pain in the me- dial heel, arch of the foot or the sole, particularly on the medial aspect (McKean 2009; Shapiro and Preston 2009)."}
{"id": "1129", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "These symptoms may increase dur- ing running, subsequently decreasing with rest (KcKean, 2009). The two most prominent clinical signs are a positive Tinel’s test and sensory impair- ment of the terminal branches of the plantar nerve. Percussion over the tibial nerve proximal to the upper border of the tarsal tunnel behind the medial malleo- lus is the best location for the Tinel’s test. Evaluating sensory impairment, via pin-pricking, and compar- ing to the non-involved foot is recommended by Oh and Meyer (1999). It is vital to differentially diag- nose TTS from L5 or S1 radiculopathy and sensory peripheral neuropathy. Lumbosacral radiculopathy generally presents with a positive straight leg raise (SLR), weakness of the calf muscles, pain radiat- ing from the lower back and a negative Tinel’s sign, whereas distal sensory peripheral neuropathy, has an objective stocking distribution sensory loss in the foot, including the dorsum and lateral aspects, and an absent Tinel’s sign (Oh and Meyer 1999; Oh 2007). In TTS there should be no objective sensory loss over the dorsum of the foot, although it may be evident on the dorsum of the toes (Oh 2007). Bilateral TTS rarely occurs; however, if suspected, the presence of a distal sensory neuropathy must be considered (Oh 2007). Plantar fasciitis is another condition requiring consideration during the diagnosing process in pa- tients with suspected TTS. Plantar fasciitis generally presents with localised pain, which is absent of sen- sory abnormalities; two factors not evident in TTS."}

Summary The upper limb, being more mobile than the lower extremity is more susceptible to nerve injury and therefore the clinicians working in sport should ex- pect a higher incidence of upper limb neuropathies than lower limb, particularly in athletes participating in contact sports such as rugby union.

In this particular cohort, whereby diver- sity exists in the type of employment, the clinician needs to be aware of neuropathies that can present as a consequence of occupation; such as CTS and TOS. Rather than being blinkered by neuropathies that typically occur in sport, the clinician who has a vast array of knowledge of various conditions will not only aid the athletes in their sporting activity, but also their activities of daily living. Case study A 30-year-old male football player, who competed once a week, reported sustaining a left hamstring injury during a game, three days prior to initial assessment, whereby he felt an “electric” pulse shoot into the ischial tuberosity region and had to stop playing immediately. The patient reported lumbar spine stiffness and a feeling of being unable to straighten the knee whilst walking. He ﬁrst noticed discomfort in the gluteal area approximately three weeks prior to assessment, which was exacerbated whilst driving, particularly whilst resting the left foot on the foot pedal. However, over the three-week pe- riod the symptoms gradually increased, whereby the patient reported a feeling of tightness in the buttock and hamstring during competition and training. During the physical assessment, the patient reported stiffness in the lumbar spine and hamstring during lumbar ﬂexion. No abnormalities were re- ported in the sacroiliac joint. All passive and resisted hip movements were negative."}

No bruising was apparent in the gluteal or posterior thigh region. The patient reported reproduction of symptoms during the Straight Leg Raise ankle dorsi-ﬂexion, which was relieved with the release of dorsi-ﬂexion. Likewise, a positive slump test, in terms of symptom reproduction and decreased knee ankle, was also observed in both the right and left limb. The patient experienced pain on palpation, with central posterior-anterior pressure on L4, L5 and S1 vertebrae, which were found on palpation to be hypomobile. It was apparent the hamstring strain occurred as a bi-product of lumbar spine pathology. A core treatment strategy utilised over the course of reha- bilitation was the use of neural sliding techniques during the slump test. Considering the acuteness and irritability of the condition and the fact neural symptoms had been experienced for three weeks prior to hamstring injury onset, sliding techniques were deemed the most appropriate neurodynamic treatment tool. The patient was instructed to execute the sliders as frequently as possible, particularly if he had been driving for a signiﬁcant period of time. Manual therapy and a home exercise programme of stabilisation exercises were also implemented into the patient’s treatment plan to address the underlying lumbar spine problem."}

Central to this is the concept of periodisation, or the structured and sequential planning of training to allow the athlete to make optimal gains in sports perfor- mance and produce their best performances in key competitions, with minimal risk of overtrain- ing or injury. Previous research has also demon- strated that compared to non-periodised training programmes, periodised training programmes result in greater increases in strength, power and sports performance (Fleck 1999; Fleck 2002; Rhea and Alderman 2004). Speciﬁcally, periodisation involves the planned and structured variation in training type, volume (intensity and duration), and rest to achieve sport- speciﬁc goals. This is achieved via the periodical progression of speciﬁc aspects of ﬁtness within a speciﬁed time frame. This style of programme al- lows for gradual and progressive overload, ensuring an optimal stimulus for adaptation whilst allowing adequate time for recovery and adaptation. Progressive overload is essential in all aspects of physical training, whether the aim is to optimise per- formance, improve body image, or rehabilitate an injury. In a periodised model, the athlete progresses through phases (meso-cycles), each of which targets a speciﬁc ﬁtness attribute, but which is planned such that the intensity and speciﬁcity advances from phase to phase and culminates in the athlete reaching their peak of sport-speciﬁc ﬁtness at the exact time of key competitions. For example, subsequent phases may focus on basic anatomical and functional adap- tations (increased range of motion, increased tendon strength, improved co-ordination and increased sta- bility), strength endurance, maximal strength, power and, ultimately, sport-speciﬁc speed and power. Such a progression requires appropriate adjustments in the frequency, intensity and duration of individual train- ing sessions and the appropriate selection of exer- cises, sets and repetitions within each session.

Training cycles Most effective training programmes break training down into cycles. This allows athletes to focus on different attributes at different times, helps with the prevention of overtraining, and is convenient as training can be made to coincide with our own cycles (for example, weeks, seasons, years and Olympiads). Training cycles can last from days to years and, depending on their length, are termed macro-cycles, meso-cycles and micro-cycles (Table 9.1). A macro-cycle represents several months or years, for example, the general conditioning period, the whole training year, or the four years of an Olympiad. A meso-cycle is a smaller block, usually consisting of a number of weeks or months of training (usually pri- oritised towards a particular training outcome, such as strength endurance, maximal strength, power, peaking, active rest, aerobic endurance, or anaerobic threshold), interspersed with periods of reduced training to facilitate rejuvenation. In this way, meso-cycles can be structured to maximise the recu- perative effects of the recovery periods and minimise the risk of overtraining. Micro-cycles are smaller blocks such as an individual training day/week."}

This is a basic form of shock training with the four weeks termed ordinary, development, shock and recovery (Matveyev 1981). A meso-cycle typically consists of one or two full 4-week cycles. A 4-week meso-cycle may look like Figure 9.1. An 8-week meso-cycle may look like Figure 9.2. Meso-cycles that use such a 4-week training block place a great deal of short-term accumulative stress on the body. It is possible that full recovery between sessions or even micro-cycles is not achieved until week four. Prior to this the athlete will accumulate fatigue as the overall training load increases.

For example the training of speed, maximal strength, technique and the learning of new skills should be emphasised during the early weeks of each four-week cycle, when the athlete is relatively fresh and receptive to such methods. During later weeks the most trainable attributes will be cardiovascular endurance, anaer- obic power, local muscular endurance and speed endurance. The improvements in ﬁtness from such a pattern of training are illustrated in Figure 9.3. The training year The most common macro-cycle is the training year, which in turn consists of a number of meso-cycles and micro-cycles. Every training year consists of a preparation phase, a performance phase and a re- cuperation phase (Figure 9.4), which vary in length Adaptation pattern from traditional train–recover cycle  Adaptation pattern from a shock training pattern Figure 9.3 A comparison of traditional and shock train- ing adaptations.depending on the competition schedule of each par- ticular sport. The preparation phase itself may be considered in greater detail and further divided into a general preparation period, a speciﬁc preparation period and a pre-competition period (Matveyev 1965).

This period predominantly focuses on strength endurance (8–20 repetitions, 3–5 sets, 3–4 days per week) (Plisk and Stone 2003), but also includes some power exercises, cardiovascular ﬁtness, ﬂex- ibility training and technique work. This phase is characterised by a progressive increase in both vol- ume (primary aim) and intensity (secondary aim) of training. Note: Although this period is about general preparation, athletes should not neglect their practice of sport speciﬁc skills. These skills should be incorporated into the training via dedicated, short duration, high quality practices, or included as part of a functional dynamic warm-up. This will help ensure that athletes maintain the skills and coordination required in competition. For example, during this period sprinters may be focusing many of their track sessions on speed endurance, rather than pure speed. This, however, does not preclude the athletes performing short bursts of maximum speed running, or quick feet coordination drills, as part of their warm-up. Specific conditioning and pre-competition period The aim of this phase is to provide a progressive transition from the broad general ﬁtness towards the highly speciﬁc ﬁtness required by competition. It can last from a few weeks (English Premiership football) through to two or three months (sprinters) and consists of a progressive increase in intensity and decrease in volume of training with a greater emphasis of sports speciﬁc activities and skills, func- tional speeds and actual sports practices."}

Transition/recuperation period/active rest This period usually lasts around a month, depending on the sport, the stresses of the previous compet- itive season and the timing of the next one. The aims are to achieve full recuperation in readiness for the general preparation period ahead. This pe- riod allows any injuries to heal and a period of re- habilitation to occur so that the athlete is ready to resume full training. It is also a time of relaxation and enjoyment. The stresses of competitive sport are far more than just physical. Athletes need time to un-wind and relax. Rest should be taken from the hard training and competition but athletes must also remain active and partake in activities unrelated to their sport. This helps with weight management but also enables the athlete to maintain a degree of gen- eral ﬁtness going into the general preparation phase. The activities should be novel and fresh and not too demanding (low volume: 1–3 repetitions, 1–3 sets, ∼3 days per week) (Plisk and Stone 2003)."}
{"id": "1157", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "A similar strategy can be adopted when peaking/tapering for competition. There are speciﬁc goals for each meso-cycle of training (usually completed in the order below) as proposed by Bompa (1999). These phases include: r Anatomical adaptation – the development of tech- nique and preparation of the musculoskeletal sys- tem (including connective tissues) for the heavier loads used in the following stages (these are usu- ally addressed in the general conditioning phase).r Hypertrophy (strength endurance) – high volume (repetitions of 8–20 at 50–80% –1RM, for 4–6 sets).r Strength – which can be subdivided into maximal strength (repetitions of 3–6 at 80–90% –1RM, for 4–8 sets), speed strength (repetitions of 8–15 at <70% –1RM, for 3–4 sets) and strength endurance (repetitions of 20–30 at 30–40% –1RM, for 2–3 sets) (Plisk and Stone 2003).r Power – can be trained via two primary methods; plyometrics and variations of the ‘Olympic lifts’. However, it is worth noting that few athletes ‘natu- rally’ have the attributes to perform ‘Olympic lifts’ safely and effectively and therefore this needs to be developed in the early stages of training (McGill 2006). It is also important to select the component of the lift that is most suitable for the training goal, for example lower limb biomechanics during the second pull is similar to the mechanics of a vertical jump. During ‘Olympic lifts’ and their variations it is not necessary to use maximal load as Kawamori et al. (2005) showed that lighter loads (50–70% –1RM) resulted in a greater power output due to a higher velocity."}

This approach will not only reduce the risk of injury, but also ensure that each phase of training is as productive as possible/intended. Differences between sports The length of the preparation, competition, transi- tion periods and associated meso-cycles, changes from sport to sport and athlete to athlete. For example, a track and ﬁeld athlete may have two or three key competitions throughout the course of a three-month competitive season. The rest of the year is effectively preparation for these key competitions. In contrast, an English Premiership football team may only have a six- or seven-week preparation period preceding a nine-month competitive season, during which players are expected to compete on a weekly or a twice-weekly basis. Swimmers often have major competitions arranged on 13- or 14- week cycles. Professional boxers may have between three and four ﬁghts a year, with their training always geared towards preparation for the next ﬁght. Despite the different conditions encountered during the preparation for these sports, the following general principles still apply. A gradual build-up in volume (and intensity) early on; as the competition approaches the intensity or quality increases further, whilst the volume tapers off."}
{"id": "1160", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Application to sports performance For athletes with limited training experience the in- corporation of a periodisation plan provides an excel- lent framework to develop an athlete’s lifting skills, as well as their strength and power. For example, if an individual wishes to compete in Olympic weight- lifting but has never actually completed a structured resistance training programme, they need to start with the basic components of the ‘Olympic’ lifts, and progress to the point where they are as strong as possible in each of these components, while they learn the complete ‘Olympic’ lifts. Each meso-cycle should teach progressively more complex compo- nents of the lifts to ensure correct technique and to allow for the appropriate anatomical and functional adaptations (neuromuscular control, active range of motion, joint stability, tendon strength) to occur un- til the complete lifts (snatch and clean and jerk) can be performed (Table 9.4). See Appendix 1 and 2 for illustrations of the clean and snatch. By the end of the ﬁrst macro-cycle, the athlete should be conﬁdent/competent at performing each of the primary lifts, but should have also developed a considerable level of strength in the key exercises (back squat, front squat, overhead squat, deadlift, Romanian deadlift, see Figures 9.6–9.10). During the next macro-cycle, the athlete can focus on devel- oping additional strength in each of the key exercises of the individual lifts, while progressively increasing load on the ‘Olympic lifts’. This allows the athlete to perform the primary lifts with additional weight whilst maintaining good technique at high velocities to ensure the development of power. The next macro-cycle should place greater em- phasis on the loads lifted during the clean and jerk and the snatch. The previous phase should have en- sured adequate anatomical adaptations during each of the components of the lifts to ensure adequate conditioning for the lifts to be performed at higher loads. To ensure that the client can decelerate during the catch phase of the snatch, initial deceleration training begins with drop jumps and then progresses to snatch balances, which mimic the catch phase of the snatch (Figure 9.11) and develop adequate trunk strength to decelerate the torso and bar during the rapid decent to the catch phase; a similar progression can also be seen for the clean (drop jumps, clean balance) (Figure 9.12) and the split jerk (split squat, overhead split squat), (Figure 9.13)."}

Appropriate conditioning and prepa- ration for these athletes is essential to ensure that these athletes are adequately prepared to perform these types of exercises.

Hypertrophy (strength endurance) in this ex- ample is not a speciﬁc goal; therefore this is used as a transition phase between anatomical adapta- tions and strength. The focus of the strength train- ing phase is to maximise the loads that the ath- lete can use during the power phase. The strength phase is subdivided into two phases: strength and maximal strength, which allows appropriate pro- gression of loads through to near maximal loads (>90% –1RM). The power phase incorporates two primary methods: plyometrics and variations of the ‘Olympic lifts’, which provide the opportunity for the athlete to develop near maximal force at high velocity (Olympic variations), and near maximal ve- locity high force production (plyometrics) that as- sist with initial acceleration and maximal velocity sprinting, respectively.

The athlete wants to begin training with the squad and playing in matches. However, most non-contact ACL injuries occur during rapid deceler- ation and cutting manoeuvres (Agel 2005) or during landing (Boden et al.2000a, 2000b), which both involve high velocity, high force eccentric loading. ‘Normal’ ACL rehabilitation does not appropriately condition the athlete for such demands, therefore it is essential that the rehabilitation process is speciﬁc to the demands of the sport. To achieve this, it is essen- tial to understand the mechanisms of ACL injury. Re- cent evidence suggests that decreased activation and possible inadequate strength in the gluteus medius, especially in female athletes, can lead to increased knee valgus (Zazulak et al.2005; Hanson et al.2008), which is a common factor in acute ACL injury."}

Therefore, to reduce the risk of non-contact ACL injuries and their recurrence, it is essential that the athlete is appropriately conditioned to cope with rapid deceleration (high velocity eccentric loading) and changes in direction (high velocity eccentric loading followed immediately by high velocity con- centric muscle actions – plyometric movements). As females, generally, appear to be quadriceps domi- nant during deceleration in landing and cutting ma- noeuvres (Hanson et al.2008), it is essential that adequate guteus medius and maximus strength is developed (this must be developed in a functional"}

Eccentric hamstring exercises, such as Nordic hamstring lowers, are more effective than con- centric training (Kaminski et al.1998; Mjolsnes et al.2004; Kilgallon et al.2007), improving the hamstring: quadriceps ratio, especially at higher velocities (Mjolsnes et al.2004; Holcomb et al.2007). This type of activity will also condition the muscles for the speciﬁc eccentric component required during deceleration, albeit at a slower velocity. Based on the periodisation model, and taking into account the current research and guidelines on plyo- metric training, there are a number of phases (meso- cycles) required to train the athlete to a point where they are appropriately conditioned for return to their sport."}

It is essential that the hamstrings are not neglected at this stage as squatting is not a sufﬁcient training stimulus to ensure their development (McCaw and Melrose 1999; Escamilla et al.1998, 2001; Ander- son et al.2006) r Low intensity plyometric movements, such as low- level drop jumps should be practiced to ensure that the athlete has the appropriate foot placement, limb movement, balance and posture (McGill 2006), while developing strength r Plyometric movements should be integrated be- ginning with primarily vertical movements, fol- lowed by forward momentum, then lateral move- ments ﬁnally progressing to multidirectional movements which gradually become more sport speciﬁc. It is essential that during a conditioning pro- gramme (such as the previous example Tables 9.6 and 9.7) the athlete still addresses other issues, such as ensuring restoration of adequate range of motion for their sport, whilst prioritising the training of cor- rect landing, cutting and deceleration strategies to minimise the risk of recurrence of ACL injury dur- ing their skill training (Ford et al.2003, Hewett et al.2005a; Hanson et al.2008).

Russell University of California, Irvine Introduction and aims The experience of acute injury can be devastating to an athlete. Catastrophic injury is an obvious exam- ple, but even less severe occurrences can adversely affect an athlete because of fears and thoughts of the unknown: How severe is it?Can I carry on play- ing?What if I have to sit out – for how long?Will I lose my place on the team?All of these and many more can negatively impact a situation that is al- ready antithetical to sport “activity.”Thus the sport rehabilitator and the rest of the healthcare team must ensure that the management of acute injury creates the best environment possible for a successful return of the athlete to full function. With this as the ul- timate goal, the aims of the chapter are to describe the nature and occurrence patterns of acute sport in- jury, to present a general plan for assessing acute sport injury, to recommend appropriate methods for managing acute sport injury; and to provide a foun- dation on which to base more detailed presentations of speciﬁc injuries in various body regions. Common acute injuries in sport Injury epidemiology Intuitively it is not possible to eliminate injuries in sport, however, the incidence of injuries can be re- duced. For the year 2002 the Royal Society for the Prevention of Injuries reported 710,018 injuries in the United Kingdom in activities classiﬁed as sport (excluding in educational venues), running, cycling or riding (Royal Society for the Prevention of Ac- cidents 2009)."}
{"id": "1186", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The UK’s Leisure Accident Surveil- lance System (LASS) estimated that the total number of sport injuries occurring in the United Kingdom in 2002 (the last year for which data are available) was 824,182 (Department of Trade and Industry 2003). More than 525,000 of these occurred in ball sports where implements (e.g., sticks, bats) were not used. This reﬂects the immense popularity – and the high injury rates – of football and rugby. Football injury rates have been reported to be 25.9 per 1000 player- match hours (i.e. injuries occurring in matches) and 3.4 per 1000 player-training hours (i.e. injuries oc- curring in training) in England’s Premiership and First and Second professional divisions (Hawkins and Fuller 1999). Rugby’s injury rate is even higher: in preparation for and participation in the Rugby World Cup by the England national team, injury rates were reported as 218 per 1000 player-match hours and 6.1 injuries per 1000 player-training hours, with an overall rate of 17 injuries per 1000 hours (Brooks et al.2005). In the 2007 Rugby World Cup epidemi- ology study, injury rates for all teams taken together were reported at 83.9 injuries per 1000 player-match hours and 3.5 injuries per 1000 player-training hours (Fuller et al.2008).

However, it is clear that all sports carry inherent risk of injury for participants. It is therefore important to understand the epidemiolog- ical terms related to injury. Incidence is the number of new occurrences of an injury or illness in a given time period and prevalence is the number of injuries that are present in a given population at a speciﬁed time (Anonymous 2005; Caine et al.2006). Three speciﬁc terms have been presented in the context of analysing sport injury incidence (Knowles et al.2006): incidence proportion, incidence rate and clin- ical incidence. Incidence proportion is the number of injured athletes divided by the number of athletes at risk and represents the average risk of injury for an athlete (Knowles et al.2006). Incidence rate refers to the number of injuries in a given quantity of time."}

One of the key factors of any systematic injury survey that provides data about acute injury epi- demiology is the deﬁnition of injury and related pa- rameters (van Mechelen et al.1996; Ekstrand and Karlsson 2003; Brooks and Fuller 2006; Hodgson et al.2007). The National Collegiate Athletic As- sociation’s Injury Surveillance System (ISS) has recorded injuries in university athletes in America since 1982 (National Collegiate Athletic Association 2008). A reportable injury is deﬁned in this database as one that: Occurs as a result of participation in an organized intercollegiate [i.e. inter-university] practice or com- petition; requires medical attention by a [healthcare professional]; and results in restriction of the student- athlete’s participation or performance for one or more days beyond the day of injury. (p. 109) In other words, an episode is not considered an injury until, at a minimum; it compromises an ath- lete’s ability to participate in their sport on the day following the episode. This deﬁnition is not universal, however. Hodgson et al. ("}

Contrast of the foregoing classiﬁca- tion with the following underscores the difﬁculty in comparing injury rates among research articles. King et al. (2009) recommended this deﬁnition of injury for the entirety of rugby league: Any pain or disability that occurs during participa- tion in rugby league match or training activities that is sustained by a player, irrespective of the need for match or training time loss or for ﬁrst aid or medical attention. An injury that results in a player requir- ing ﬁrst aid or medical attention is referred to as a “medical attention injury” and an injury that results in the player being unable to partake in full part of future training and/or match activities is referred to as a “time loss” injury. (p. 13) The dissimilarity with the ISS deﬁnition is obvi- ous and substantial. Analogous variation exists, as well, between the ISS and King et al.deﬁnitions of exposure. An “athlete exposure” is the ISS’s ba- sic measure of risk, being deﬁned as one athlete participating in one training session or one compe- tition in which they are exposed to the potential for being injured (National Collegiate Athletic Associ- ation 2008).

(p. 14) In a study of the ISS for the years 1988–2004 (Hootman et al.2007), injuries are statistically more likely to occur during competitions than during train- ing (13.8 versus 4.0 injuries per 1,000 athlete expo- sures). Also, injuries during pre-season training were signiﬁcantly higher (6.6 injuries per 1,000 athlete exposures) than injuries occurring during a sport’s season (2.3 injuries per 1,000 athlete exposures) and after the season (1.4 injuries per 1,000 athlete exposures). The general tendencies of these results – if not the injury rates – are similar to observations made about rugby injuries in England (Brooks et al.2008) and Australia (Gabbett 2004). Another interesting ﬁnding is that across all sports, university male athletes are 3.5 times more likely to suffer a non-time-loss injury than a time-loss injury (Powell and Dompier 2004)."}

A very use- ful tool for determining the healthcare requirements of a variety of sports has been proposed and is based on injury incidence rate and the relative personnel load of providing care for injuries incurred in uni- versity sports (National Athletic Trainers’ Associ- ation 2007). Injury rate index is based on risk of injury combined with risk of catastrophic (brain and spine) injury. Table 10.1 summarises relevant data. A higher Health Care Index suggests that a sport requires more medical attention. While comparable data for cricket and rugby could not be found, the information presented is helpful for the sport reha- bilitator’s understanding about the nature of injury in sport and the demand for healthcare each sport engenders.

However, there are three important caveats for the examiner. First, the unin- jured limb should be tested before the injured one in order to familiarise the athlete with the evalua- tion procedures and to allay their apprehensions. If the athlete cannot relax, muscle guarding will com- promise the testing. Second, a previously injured contralateral joint may not be a suitable “normal” standard against which to judge the currently injured joint. Third, a systematic method for evaluating each region of the body is most effective and efﬁcient for completing the examination process without missing important diagnostic details. Serving as one common example that will be en- countered by virtually all sport rehabilitators, the evaluation of an acute knee injury includes special tests such as: r Apprehension sign for patellar dislocation/ subluxation r Lachman’s test for anterior cruciate ligament in- tegrity r Anterior drawer test for anterior cruciate ligament integrity r Posterior gravity sign for posterior cruciate liga- ment integrity r Pivot shift test for anterolateral rotary instability r McMurray’s test for meniscal damage r Apley’s grind test for meniscal damage r Ottawa Knee Rules (Stiell et al.1995, 1996; Tigges et al.1999) to rule out fracture.

The sport rehabilitator confronted with this type of ankle injury will assign a severity grade to the sprain based on the results of the clinical examination (see Table 10.4). A partially torn ligament – categorised as a grade 2 sprain – can encompass a wide range of damage, whilst a grade 3 sprain is a complete rupture"}

The determination by the examiner of a limit – or an endpoint – to their stress exam of the joint is important. The endpoint is created by any remaining intact ligament restricting the movement. A grade 3 sprain does not exhibit such a limit; rather, an indistinct, soft endpoint is present because the torn ligament cannot oppose the stress the examiner places on the ankle. However, the examiner must remember that many subjective subtleties exist in evaluating ligament damage because there are virtually inﬁnite ways that ligaments supporting a joint can be injured. The amount of joint instability may be graded instead of the degree of injury to a speciﬁc ligament (Hilde- brand et al.,2007). For instance, a grade 2 instabil- ity may be present when one ligament is completely torn and the others around a joint are not. But, partial tears to two or more ligaments about the joint may also result in the same type of instability. This under- scores the need for the sport rehabilitator to practise a systematic method of ligament injury evaluation."}

Acute ankle injury: history There are certain customary questions to ask an injured athlete, and some of these depend on the body region involved. A framework of “What, When, Where, How?”may be helpful. It is ideal to develop a routine examination methodology in order to fa- cilitate the process and ensure one does not miss important diagnostic clues.

Acute ankle injury: inspection At this point the examiner looks carefully at both the injured and uninjured ankles to assess swelling, ec- chymosis (bluish discolouration), and other visible signs that may add information to the assessment. The athlete’s ankle exhibits an area of swelling an- terior to the lateral malleolus that is approximately the size of a table tennis ball. Examiner: Where would you say it hurts the most?Can you place one ﬁnger at that spot?The player points to a location about 1.5 cm an- terior to the lateral malleolus; this is an area over the anterior taloﬁbular ligament and the spot where the swelling is located. There are no other areas of swelling nor are there other outward signs of injury."}

Acute ankle injury: palpation First the examiner palpates the uninjured extrem- ity in order, again, to familiarise the player with the process and to reduce his apprehension. Then the ex- aminer begins to gently palpate various places about the foot, ankle and leg of the player’s injured limb, starting with areas that are not likely to be painful in order to keep the player at ease. It is crucial that the clinician be well versed in clinical anatomy for this portion of the injury examination. Locations and structures the examiner palpates are: r Ligaments (to investigate possible sprains) ◦deltoid ligament ◦anterior taloﬁbular ligament ◦calcaneoﬁbular ligament ◦anterior tibioﬁbular ligament ◦calcaneocuboid ligament r Bones (to investigate the possibility of associated fractures) ◦base of the 5th metatarsal, to assess an avulsion fracture ◦metaphysis and diaphysis of the 5th metatarsal, to assess a shaft fracture or Jones (proximal di- aphyseal/metaphyseal) fracture ◦lateral malleolus ◦ﬁbula, extending up the leg to the ﬁbular neck in order to assess a Maisonneuve fracture ◦dorsal talus ◦navicular ◦calcaneus r Tendons and muscles (to investigate possible strains) ◦Achilles tendon ◦peroneal tendons, extending up the leg to their muscles ◦tibialis anterior tendon ◦tibialis posterior tendon. The examiner does not note any pain or crepitus on bony structures, so the suspicion for fracture is low. Palpating the soft tissue structures does not elicit pain except for the anterior taloﬁbular ligament; this is accompanied by a sensation of ballottement as the examiner presses over the swollen tissue.

Our basketball player exhibits the following re- sults of ligament testing: r Eversion stress: not painful and no instability (ﬁrm endpoint) compared to contralateral ◦Impression: deltoid ligament intact r Forced dorsiﬂexion: no pain elicited ◦Impression: anterior tibioﬁbular ligament intact r Twisting foot in the mortise: no pain elicited ◦Impression: anterior tibioﬁbular ligament intact r Inversion stress test in anatomical position: very slightly painful anterior to the lateral malleolus at end of range and no instability compared to contralateral ◦Impression: calcaneoﬁbular ligament intact; based on its location, the mild pain is likely em- anating from the anterior taloﬁbular ligament r Inversion stress test in plantar ﬂexion: moderate pain that worsens at end of range of movement and questionable slight instability compared to con- tralateral ◦Impression: grade 1 or 2 anterior taloﬁbular lig- ament sprain r Anterior drawer test: moderate pain that worsens at end of range of movement and slight instability compared to contralateral ◦Impression: grade 2 anterior taloﬁbular ligament sprain.

Sport rehabilitators and other allied health professionals should familiarise themselves with these important adjuncts to ankle injury evalu- ation. Acute ankle injury: information collating and decision making After executing the history, inspection, palpation and special testing steps, the sport rehabilitator arrives at the clinical impression of a grade 2 sprain of the an- terior taloﬁbular ligament. Following is a summary of the examination details that led to this decision.r Mechanism of injury: inversion with plantar ﬂex- ion, a movement that places the anterior taloﬁbular ligament under tension r Location of swelling and pain: anterior to the lat- eral malleolus, which is the anatomical location of the anterior taloﬁbular ligament r Pain and slight laxity in the ankle: occurs dur- ing inversion and plantar ﬂexion testing that place tension on the injured ligament, suggesting that a portion of the ligament is disrupted; note that in this case there is an equivocal impression when considering only the inversion exam with plantar ﬂexion – the anterior drawer test result adds clini- cal information r Associated fracture likelihood: not likely, as the player arrived at the clinic with full weight bearing ambulation and palpation of the bony structures did not reveal pain; thus, the Ottawa Ankle Rules suggest no fracture. Certainly injury examination is very subjective, al- though a systematic evaluation scheme helps reduce variability in the assessment process. Nonetheless, there is no substitute for the experience of exam- ining as many injuries as possible in order to gain the ability to discern subtleties present in the wide variety of cases. Both proper clinical education and clinical experience are essential for effective injury care. First aid and initial therapeutic measures The acronym PRICE is the standard for acute care of sport injury. This is a reminder of ﬁve steps: applica- tion of Protection, Rest, Ice, Compression and Ele- vation (Flegel 2008)."}
{"id": "1209", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "An alternative, RICES – Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation, Stabilisation – has been proposed (Knight 2008; Knight and Draper 2008), but portrays the same basic meaning. The generally accepted period for the acute treatment described be- low is the ﬁrst 48–72 hours after the injury. Knight (2008) suggests for clarity’s sake that acute care be subdivided into three phases: emergency (encom- passing CPR or urgent transport to A&E), immedi- ate (from time of injury to 12 hours post-injury) and transition care (from 12 hours to 4 days post-injury). No matter how the initial period of time following an injury is apportioned, the success of follow-up treat- ment depends substantially on the initial treatment that is applied. Protection by bracing, splinting, or non-weight bearing transport of an injured athlete is under- taken when necessary to minimise the risk of further trauma to an injured area. Proper ﬁrst aid techniques at this initial stage are crucial to the athlete’s well- being. Rest from the activity that caused the injury, or similar activities, is warranted when the opportunity exists for reinjury or further injury. In the last several years, the “gold standard” of cold – or cryotherapy – as an injury treatment has been analysed for its efﬁcacy in evidence-based prac- tice (Ernst and Fialka 1994; Lessard et al.1997; Bleakley et al.2004; Hubbard and Denegar 2004; Collins 2008)."}

Whilst cold slows oedema formation, it does not reduce oedema that is already present (Knight and Draper 2008). A typical application of therapeutic cold should last no longer than 20 minutes (Bleakley et al.2006; Flegel 2008); approximately one hour should elapse before another cold treatment in order to allow the tissue to rewarm. As with all treatment procedures there are important caveats. More body tissue heat is given off (resulting in lower tissue temperature) to a 10◦cold pack than to a 20◦cold pack (Knight and Draper 2008) and by body regions with a thinner insulating fat layer (Otte et al.2002) or a larger sur- face area covered by the treatment modality (Knight and Draper 2008). Therefore, longer treatment times or more intense forms of treatment further increase heat loss and can instigate tissue damage (Knight 1995; Knight and Draper 2008). Moreover, research suggests that muscular power and functional per- formance are reduced even after a 10 minute ice application (Fischer et al.2009)."}

Application of an elastic or crepe bandage provides some compression and a general reassurance to the athlete, although a pneumatic stirrup-type of brace has been shown to be more effective in treating ankle sprains (Boyce et al.2005). Intermittently applied compression may be beneﬁcial, as well, especially when applied in con- junction with cryotherapy (Starkey 1976; Quillen and Rouillier 1982; Mora et al.2002). Research in this area related to patients with chronic oedema- tous pathology is instructive (Delis et al.2000; Van- scheidt et al."}

Of concern in the common sport injury of an- kle sprain are the contours of the medial and lateral malleoli. This topology about the ankle may pre- vent the areas anterior and posterior to the malleoli from receiving adequate compression by an elas- tic or crepe bandage. This is because the bandage bridges across from the anterior and posterior an- kle surfaces to the malleoli, thus leaving the spaces Figure 10.2 The shaded areas denote the shape and lo- cation for placement of a foam or chiropody felt horse- shoe pad as a compressive element in treating acute ankle sprain.

Horseshoe shaped pads cut from 1 cm (3/8 inch) foam or chiropody felt and positioned under- neath the bandage during wrapping – as shown in Figure 10.2 – may improve elimination of oedema in these areas (Wilkerson and Horn-Kingery 1993; Merrick 2004). Elevation of the injured extremity so the ankle is positioned above the level of the heart is an- other technique that promotes a decrease in swelling (Rucinkski et al.1991). Gravity assists venous re- turn, as well as lymphatic drainage of ﬂuid collected in the interstitial spaces (Dale et al."}

However, a return of the limb to the non-elevated, or gravity- dependent, position may reverse the oedema reduc- tion gained by elevation (Tsang et al.2003). Thus, elevation for as much time as possible is important during the period of acute injury management. Pain management in acute musculoskeletal sport injury A number of therapeutic modalities are available to- day for treatment of various aspects of sport injury.

It is important in applying any type of modality to a patient or client that the clinician has an appropriate aim for such application as well as an understanding about the physiology of the modality and its effects on the body. Physical agents The two traditional physical agents best suited to successful management of acute injury pain are cryotherapy and electrotherapy (Merrick 2004). There are many methods of cryotherapy (Swenson et al.1996; Bleakley, et al.2004), though not all are equivalent in their efﬁcacy (Bleakley et al.2004). As previously mentioned, cold treatment is effec- tive for ameliorating pain among other therapeu- tic effects like slowing development of haematoma and oedema, decreasing nerve conduction velocity, reducing muscle spasm (Swenson et al.1996), re- ducing local blood ﬂow in the injured area (Knight and Londeree 1980) and minimising secondary metabolic injury (Merrick et al.1999; Knight and Draper 2008)."}
{"id": "1216", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "In terms of method of application, it is somewhat difﬁcult to make a recommendation because tech- niques and published ﬁndings are so varied (Bleak- ley et al.2004, 2007). A simple ice bag is usually the most expeditious and inexpensive means of apply- ing cold. It has many proponents (McMaster et al.1978; Merrick 2004; Bleakley, et al.2006; Knight and Draper 2008), although it has been shown that a 20 minute cold whirlpool bath procured a longer tissue temperature reduction than did a 20 minute crushed ice pack treatment for the leg (Myrer et al.1998). A protocol of a 10 minute ice pack appli- cation, 10 minutes without ice and then another 10 minutes of ice pack lowered tissue temperature better than a single 20 minute ice pack treatment (Bleakley et al.2006). The effective cooling by ice is related to the phase change that it undergoes from a solid to a liquid as it melts (Merrick et al."}
{"id": "1217", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2003). The combina- tion of therapeutic cold and exercise, or cryokinetics (Hayden 1964; Knight 1995; Bleakley et al.2007; Knight and Draper 2008), is especially beneﬁcial be- cause of the way early motion promotes subsequent rehabilitation. In this technique pain is managed by the cold treatment and then the athlete undertakes a controlled exercise regimen, followed by another cycle of cold. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is an electrotherapy modality shown to be effective for musculoskeletal pain (Hsueh et al.1997; Bertalanffy et al.2005). It electrically stimulates sen- sory nerves around an injured body region to in- terfere with pain stimuli. The gate control theory (Melzack and Wall 1965; Dickenson 2002) deﬁnes how high-frequency TENS mediates the sensation of pain. Pain impulses on α-δ and C nerve ﬁbres in the spinal cord are interrupted by sensory infor- mation transmitted via α-β afferent nerves (Mer- rick 2004)."}
{"id": "1218", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Thus, if the TENS signal stimulates the α-β ﬁbres to a great enough degree, those nerve signals will close a “gate” in the spinal cord for the pain stimuli and be perceived instead of the pain. Although it has been applied to acute muscu- loskeletal pain scenarios, systematic review of the research is inconclusive about the efﬁcacy of TENS (Walsh et al.2009), and a lack of randomisation in clinical trials leads to over-estimation of the posi- tive effects of the treatment (Carroll et al.1996). In acute low back pain patients, therapeutic exercise with TENS was not assistive to patient recovery in comparison to exercise alone (Herman et al.1994). Neither was it a beneﬁt for patients with acute post- operative pain following lumbar surgery (McCallum et al.1988). However, in a randomised, double-blind study of trauma patients at A&E TENS was as effec- tive as oral medication for analgesia (Ordog 1987). There are several different TENS units on the market, a myriad of musculoskeletal injuries and numerous protocols with which TENS can be applied to these injuries."}

High-voltage, low-frequency electrical stimula- tion also can be useful for managing acute pain (Merrick 2004). The intention for this modality is to elicit release of an opioid substance called beta- endorphin that naturally occurs in the body (Hughes et al.1984; Bender et al.2007); beta-endorphin is a powerful mediator of pain (Bender et al.2007). The treatment may be somewhat uncomfortable to the patient because of the waveform and frequency, but this stimulation is what makes the technique ef- fective in bringing forth release of beta-endorphin"}

A ﬁnal type of electrotherapy that often is effective for acute pain management is interferential current (Merrick 2004; Jorge et al.2006). This technique’s name is derived from its two electromagnetic ﬁelds that cross each other; at their point of intersection is a localised ﬁeld of interference caused by their competing current phases. The current in this ﬁeld continually changes, a property that precludes ac- commodation by the nerves in the treatment area and which yields analgesia via the gate control mecha- nism (Merrick 2004). Whilst interferential current has been shown to be similarly effective compared to TENS, research about it is scant (Johnson and Tabasam 2003). Certainly its usage is conﬁned to a clinical setting, perhaps making TENS preferable simply because of easier device portability and the ability of patients to operate the equipment. Pharmacological agents Topical analgesics Topical methods of analgesia are enjoying renewed interest in healthcare because of the challenges in- herent with administering pain medications via other routes (Stanos 2007). Among the non-prescription compounds available, counterirritants are one of the oldest and most widely used. They are marketed under such brand names as Sports Muscle Rub, Muellergesic, BioFreeze, Tiger Balm and Deep Heat Cream."}

A double- blind study of the effects of oral versus topical gel ibuprofen reported no difference between the two de- livery methods for all therapeutic measures (White- ﬁeld et al.2002). Other studies corroborate the ef- ﬁcacy of topical NSAIDs (Dominkus et al.1996; Rovensk´y et al.2001; Banning 2008); but, this de- pends on the relative depth (e.g. superﬁcial versus intra-articular) of the pain’s origin (Dominkus et al.1996; Miyatake et al.2009)."}

It is generally thought to be a safe and ef- fective medication (Graham et al.2003; Kehlet and Werner 2003), although some concern exists that liver toxicity is possible even at commonly used non- prescription doses (Jalan et al.2007). Paracetamol also has been shown to be as efﬁcacious in acute mus- culoskeletal pain as non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (Woo et al.2005; Gøtzsche 2006). Nonetheless the drug is not without side-effects and controversy (Moynihan 2002; Ahmad 2007); and, assuredly it must not be offered nor ingested indiscriminately. The sport rehabilitator has a role and responsibility in properly advising athletes, patients and clients in the approved use of this and other medicinal prepa- rations.

As- sessing the risks and beneﬁts of this class of phar- maceuticals can be complex (Patrono and Rocca 2009). As mentioned above, some studies suggest that for typical pain from acute musculoskeletal in- jury, NSAIDs and Paracetamol are similarly effec- tive. Unquestionably, administration of prescription NSAIDs or over-the-counter NSAIDs (e.g. ibupro- fen) at prescription strength doses is unethical with- out the care of a GP or consultant. The sport re- habilitator must adhere to approved applications of NSAIDs and discourage improper NSAID use when advising individuals under their care. Concussion An understanding of concussion as an acute injury is crucial to the sport rehabilitator. Whilst it is not the typical musculoskeletal injury, it can be considerably more serious and troublesome to manage. Concus- sion is deﬁned as “a trauma-induced alteration in mental status that may or may not involve loss of consciousness” (American Academy of Neurology 1997, p. 582).

Table 10.6 summarises his analysis. Collision sports (e.g. rugby, North Ameri- can football), sports where the participants or projec- tiles move at high velocity (e.g. alpine skiing, motor- sports, skateboarding, cricket, baseball, ice hockey) and pugilistic sports (e.g. boxing, martial arts) are particularly prone to injuries of the head and neck. Certainly protective headgear are helpful against di- rect blows in some sports, but they do not prevent all head injuries and concussion can occur with or with- out helmets (American College of Sports Medicine 2006). In football, headgear does not offer protec- tion against ball contact head injuries, but it does ap- pear to reduce the severity of head-to-head contact injuries (Withnall et al.2005). Of particular conse- quence in sport-related brain injuries are rapid accel- eration or deceleration of the head or high velocity angular head motion (Holbourn 1945; Ommaya and Gennarelli 1974).

However, such evaluations are complex. Evidence suggests that athletes who sustain multiple concussions exhibit cumulative neurological effects (Collins et al.2002; Iverson et al.2004), experience a substantial reduction in memory ability (Iverson et al.2004) and demonstrate several pitchside neurological examination abnormalities (Collins et al.2002) when compared to athletes with no history of concussion."}

The precipitating event may be asso- ciated with neither direct head trauma nor loss of consciousness (Lovell et al.2004). Players usually are anxious to return to the match/competition; thus, they may not report a head injury or they may at- tempt to evade examination in favour of resuming play.

Concussion: follow-up for return to sport The player presented himself to the sport medicine clinic on a daily basis. In close communication with the team physician, the sport rehabilitator evaluated the player at each visit using standard concussion evaluation techniques."}
{"id": "1234", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "A fortnight later the player’s headache was completely resolved and all other con- cussion tests were normal. However, he continued to exhibit mild myofascial neck pain with resisted cer- vical motions. This was presumed to be a residual sign of reﬂexive contraction of the neck musculature during the injury episode. At two weeks post-injury the player was referred to the radiology department for a CT scan of his neck in order to investigate the persistent pain. Review of the CT images revealed the player suffered from a previously undetected congenital tripartite C1 verte- bra. On the basis of this ﬁnding the player was ex- cluded from further participation in collision sports and counselled about alternative sporting outlets that would not expose his cervical spine to catastrophic risk. It was obviously fortunate that during his pre- ceding several years of North American football in- volvement he did not sustain a disastrous neck injury. This case exempliﬁes the need for alertness to symp- toms that may be unrelated to the primary pathology. A conservative approach is particularly appropriate for injuries to the central nervous system. Conclusion Acute management entails evaluation of the injury and application of appropriate treatments based on decisions informed by the evaluation’s results."}
{"id": "1235", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "This process, especially the evaluation, is enhanced by the clinician’s presence at training sessions and com- petitions where they can witness the mechanism of injuries. Following the injury evaluation and cate- gorisation of the injury’s nature and severity, prompt administration of proper on-site care should ensue. In non-emergent cases this will include judicious ap- plication of the PRICE method: protection, rest, ice, compression and elevation. Success in managing the acute stage of injury gen- erally leads to success in the post-acute stage and onward as the athlete is prepared by healthcare pro- fessionals and others on the sport healthcare team for re-entry to participation. Insofar as possible, it is incumbent on the sport rehabilitator to ensure this process goes smoothly, to offer physical and psycho- logical support and to keep the athlete’s best interests foremost during the progression back to full activity.

Needless to say, these come in various clinical presentations. In addition to this variety of signs and symptoms, there are numerous ways of assessing these conditions, and the various tests and questions to be asked are many. Life can, however, be made a little simpler by using the logical systems ﬁrst advocated by the late Dr James Cyriax (Cyriax 1985a). For many therapists, particularly physio- therapists, training in assessment has been based on conceptual foundations of renowned therapists such as Geoffrey Maitland (Maitland et al.2005). Although there are no problems with assessment methods based around Maitland’s philosophy, there are some fundamental differences behind his philosophy and that of Cyriax. These differences are based around the fact that Cyriax was a physician; a doctor who’s job it was to make a diagnosis in order to prescribe some treatment to the patient. This was his role during the 1950s and 1960s. This is very different from Maitland, who was an Australian physiotherapist, had no clinical autonomy back in the 1970s the like of which therapists enjoy today; in fact he would provide treatments based on a doctor’s diagnosis."}
{"id": "1265", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Maitland did, however, accept the fact that sometimes the diagnosis was not always accurate, and his methods of assessment would at the very least attempt to identify whether or not the presenting condition was of musculoskeletal origin, rather than some kind of systemic origin. He could treat the former cases, but would refer the latter cases back to the referring medic. Since both of these major assessment philosophies were introduced, medical and therapeutic knowledge has advanced and both methods of assessment have adapted accordingly. It is because of the strong emphasis in the original conceptual foundations that this chapter will concentrate on the fundamentals of assessment based on Cyriax philosophy. It must be stressed, however, that this system of assessment has been adapted from his methods, by both the author, and by orthopaedic medicine clinical groups: r Orthopaedic Medicine Seminars r Society of Orthopaedic Medicine r Association of Chartered Physiotherapist in Or- thopaedic Medicine. It is by no means meant to be a deﬁnitive method of assessment; however, it will help the manual thera- pist to reach a diagnosis in over 90% of cases. It must also be stated that this is only the basic assessment; there are many additional tests that can be added to end of each of these assessments.

Firstly, it aims to give sports rehabilitators the conceptual foundations of musculoskeletal assessment skills, using a logical system of questioning and physical testing, in order to diagnose musculoskeletal disorders. This will en- able rehabilitators to assess and diagnose many of the common disorders that affect physically active peo- ple; more detailed assessment techniques and tests relevant to speciﬁc regions of the body will be pre- sented in the relevant chapters of this book. Secondly, this chapter aims to give a simple but effective guide- line for pitch-side assessment that can be utilised in most immediate clinical sporting scenarios. Thirdly, this chapter aims to provide a framework for record- ing assessment and treatment details, using a com- monly used system for recording medical notes of this kind. The information within this chapter is de- signed to be an accompaniment to learning, and is no substitute for the practical learning and role play that has been shown to signiﬁcantly improve the di- agnostic skills of practitioners (Smith et al.2005). Fundamentals of assessment Before progressing, let us look at some fundamen- tals of assessment. Firstly, how useful are X-rays (radiographs) when it comes to assessment and di- agnosis?From a doctor’s perspective (certainly back in the 1950s), this was a major method of assessing the musculoskeletal system."}
{"id": "1267", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Cyriax realised in his early professional career that there were many con- ditions where pain was present, yet the radiographic ﬁndings were unequivocal. The problem with X-rays is that they only show dense body tissues such as the bones (Figure 11.1). All soft moving tissues are radio-translucent. If pain arises from a soft tissue, then X-rays reveal only one of two things: 1. NAD – bones appear normal; that is, negative X-ray, or 2. X-ray shows some symptomless abnormality, for example cervical spondylosis In addition to this, it often requires two radio- graphs in order to interpret meaningful informa- tion as an X-Ray is a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional structure. Figures 11.2 and 11.3 show a loose body within the knee joint, which Figure 11.1 X-Rays only show dense tissues like bone. Figure 11.2 Loose body not visible in this view."}

Secondly, how useful is palpation in assessment and diagnosis?There is always a great temptation in assessing painful problems to go ahead and put a ﬁnger to the sore area and palpate. The problem here is that not all pain is felt at the site of origin; hence palpation can very often deceive. Soft tissues have the habit of referring pain to other areas; often they refer pain on a segmental basis. Referred pain is not too confusing if following the simple “rules” that appear towards the end of this chapter. Following on from that, it should be obvious that any treatment needs to be directed at the source of, and not necessarily the site of, symptoms. There are, however, certain circumstances when the latter may be appropriate, but it cannot be assumed to be enough. For example, a client suffering with referred pain from tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) may re- quire treatment to the source of problem, such as the bone-tendon junction, but may also beneﬁt from pain relieving modalities such as TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation)."}
{"id": "1269", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "In this case, the treat- ment electrodes may be placed around the area of re- ferred pain, not just the causal site. Treatment should have a beneﬁcial effect on the particular tissues. Again this sounds obvious, but too often therapists have been guilty of performing treatments without really taking this into full consideration. The aims of treatment, therefore, should be to inﬂuence the cause of symptoms, not just relieve the symptoms. Primary decisions for assessment In the quest of diagnosis, there are some primary decisions to be made even before the assessment can begin: r About which joint does the lesion lie?r In what sort of tissue does the lesion lie?Contrac- tile/inert r Is the pain reproduced by the test?The ﬁrst question should really be answered by the initial subjective history. If the right sorts of ques- tions are asked, then an initial impression may be- come evident, at least to the extent where the reha- bilitator can decide at least which joint assessment to perform. The next two questions are answered by applying the Cyriax principle of selective tissue tensioning (Cyriax 1985a)."}
{"id": "1270", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Each tissue is selectively stressed, whilst at the same time not allowing any tension to occur at other tissues. Tissues are conve- niently divided into two tissue types: 1.contractile: muscles, tendons and all corre- sponding junctions (musculo-tendinous and teno- osseous junctions) 2.inert: bones, cartilage, ligaments, capsule, bursae, fasciae, nerve root and dura mater. One of the inert structures above also displays an ad- ditional characteristic that is signiﬁcant in diagnosis, namely the joint’s ﬁbrous capsule. Cyriax observed that joints lost their range of motion in predictable ways, which he termed Capsular Patterns: When the capsule of a joint becomes inﬂamed, whether by trauma, infection or degeneration, it con- tracts and restricts the available range of movement in a set pattern. This pattern is the same for that joint but may be different for different joints, for example: Shoulders display the same Capsular Pattern as each other, yet this differs from all knees."}

A loss of range that is not in common with the known Capsular Pattern is called a Non-capsular Pattern. Active, passive and resisted movements Active movements are often not very helpful in diag- nosis as all tissues are under tension simultaneously. However, they can give an indication of willingness to move, in addition to onset of pain, available range and end-feel to joint motion. Figure 11.4 shows ac- tive testing of shoulder ﬂexion. Passive movements stress the inert structures mainly, and provide an indication of onset of pain, range and end-feel. Passive movements should be exactly that; movements where the client is relaxed and does not attempt to help or join in with the movement. If this happens, then the client would be recruiting the contractile tissues, which may give a false positive result. Figure 11.5 shows passive test- ing of knee ﬂexion. Resisted movements put the contractile compo- nents under tension and give an idea of pain and strength."}
{"id": "1272", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Resisted tests must be performed to the maximum, and should be isometric contractions in order to ensure that the inert structures are not stressed at the same time. In order to get maxi- mum contraction, the joint needs to be in a relatively neutral position (to allow inert structures to be in a non-stretched position). This should be mid-range in order to allow the angle of force from the contractile unit to act in the most mechanically advantageous Figure 11.5 Passive testing of knee ﬂexion.position, plus allows the optimum overlap between actin and myosin ﬁlaments for strong contraction. If only 90% strength is used, and the muscle lesion lies within the untested 10% of ﬁbres, then a false negative result would be obtained by the test. Figure 11.6 shows resisted testing of the quadriceps. Essentially, it should be remembered that all tests, whether passive or resisted, are only as sensitive and speciﬁc as the rehabilitator is at performing them; there is no substitute for practising assessment techniques. Finally, it may be appropriate to use palpation in order to further localise the lesion. Further addi- tional tests may then be carried out to aid this pro- cess in some cases; this simple form of assessment will allow the rehabilitator to gain a good clinical Figure 11.6 Resisted testing of knee extension."}

Figure 11.7 shows palpation of the peroneus brevis tendon. End-feels The normal feel to the end of passive joint range of motion is often called the end-feel. The following are classed as normal end-feels: r Hard – usually due to bony opposition and feels like a solid immoveable block to movement (e.g. olecranon process meeting the olecranon fossa during full elbow extension).r Soft – usually due to soft-tissue opposition, which feels like a squashing of a sponge (e.g. hamstrings meeting calf musculature during ﬂexion of the knee).r Elastic – usually the most common end-feel for synovial joints and is associated with stretching of the joint capsule and the feeling of elastic recoil when releasing the tension (e.g. lateral rotation of the shoulder joint). Abnormal end-feels, or pathological end-feels as they indicate the presence of pathology, are as follows: r Springy – usually due to the presence of cartilage being trapped between joint surfaces and feels like a ﬁrm resistance to movement that has some give when pressure is increased (e.g. meniscus in knee ﬂexion or extension).r Spasm – this is a hard end-feel caused by sudden activation of muscles in response to the move- ment through pain, or apprehension. It is different from a normal hard end-feel in that it is not al- ways repeatable at the same point in the range of motion."}
{"id": "1274", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "r Empty – this is when no end-range is actually reached either due to the onset of extreme pain, or because of major joint disruption (i.e. torn liga- ments/capsule) which therefore offer no resistance to movement. Referred pain Referred pain is described as an error in perception; pain perceived elsewhere than at its true site is termed “referred”. The sensation of pain is an extremely complex phenomenon, and very subjective, however, certain aspects of pain perception are known (Butler 1991, 2000).r site of pain – this is sensed by the body in the sensory cortex of the brain r memory of pain – this is sensed in the temporal lobes of the brain r degree of pain – this is sensed in the frontal lobes (amount of tension in these frontal lobes may gov- ern the patient’s response to pain). Referred pain, although complex in nature, can be said to follow some general rules (Cyriax 1985a): r does not cross the mid-line of the body r has a tendency to refer distally r always refers segmentally (within a dermatome) r may be felt in all or part of a dermatome r is often felt or perceived as being deep."}
{"id": "1275", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "190 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT The use of simple rules can help to make some sense of referred pain: r usually, the deeper the site of lesion, the more vague the reference of pain and the greater the spread of reference r this is also true of the location of the lesion; that is the more proximal, the more vague and increase in spread of reference r in most cases, the stronger the stimulus, the in- crease in spread of reference. Clinical orthopaedic examination The following subheadings make the whole clin- ical assessment easier to breakdown for the pur- pose of greater understanding. Imagine the situa- tion where an unknown client enters your clinic, requiring your professional services. After introduc- ing yourself, you need to sit down with the client and glean a subjective history from them. The subjective history is literally exploring what the client feels has happened to themselves and how it is affecting them now. The objective examination, which comes af- ter, allows the rehabilitator to perform a series of objective tests – namely passive and resisted move- ments. The process of assessment is attempting to put together several pieces of a puzzle, and to stand back and look at these and attempt to recognise the puzzle; it is rare that assessment yields every piece, so some sound anatomical knowledge and clinical reasoning skills will be needed for more complex patterns of clinical ﬁndings, and it is this particular skill that is hardest to gain. The rehabilitator looks for speciﬁc key elements (e.g. onset, behaviour and symptoms, etc.)in much the same way that a de- tective looks for key elements in any investigation (e.g. motive, opportunity, forensic evidence, etc.). Diagnosis is not, therefore, made on the basis of a single positive ﬁnding, but on a pattern of clinical features."}
{"id": "1276", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Subjective examination The ﬁrst stage of the subjective examination is that of observation. Observation r Face, posture and gait It is particularly important to gauge how much pain and discomfort is the client in; one of the most accu- rate ways of doing this is to observe their face when they walk in the clinic, and when you greet them and introduce yourself to them. At this point, they are unaware that you may be observing them, and will tend to act in a more natural manner. The face can give clear indications of pain, whether severe, or prolonged, and may also give an idea of whether they have had disturbed sleep. It is a good opportu- nity to observe their posture also, and the way they move and walk. Someone with an ankle problem may walk on their heel with a relatively ﬁxed and extended knee, whilst someone with a knee problem may well walk on their toes in order to prevent full knee extension. The next stage is the interview stage. Subjective history During the subjective history taking, several ques- tions need to be asked in order to help with the diag- nostic process. The order of questions is ultimately a personal thing and does not have to follow the for- mat set out below. It is worth noting, however, that it is highly likely that as a rehabilitator you are likely to not only ask someone to get relatively undressed, but you are going to invade their “personal space” by actually physically handling their limbs or body in some manner."}
{"id": "1277", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "In which case, it seems to me to be really important to gain some rapport with the client as quickly as possible, and hence ask questions about themselves of a more general (but no less important) nature early, and follow up with the most personal questions towards the end of the subjective interview. It may also be helpful as an aide memoir to use the keywords listed below as a template around which to ask relevant questions. These are linked together as pairs: r age and occupation r site and spread r onset and duration"}
{"id": "1278", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "SUBJECTIVE EXAMINATION 191 r behaviour and symptoms r previous medical history and medication. Age Essentially, one of the ﬁrst things required to estab- lish is rapport, so to do that, you need to ask some- one’s age. One of the useful things here is that some musculoskeletal conditions are age related, for ex- ample, slipped epiphysis in young adolescent boys, or degenerative conditions in the over 50s. Occupation Paired with age is occupation; it is important to es- tablish exactly what the client does for a living. Are they a professional athlete of some kind, or are they a recreational athlete?Either way, you need to estab- lish the activity levels they need to regain as part of your treatment plan. A professional athlete is likely to require more rehabilitation than an ofﬁce worker who plays a little tennis at weekends. Equally, it needs to be established whether work or recreational activity may have any impact on the current injury – either causative or preventing recovery in some way. Site Asking the client to indicate where they feel their problem is can be enlightening in that it may indi- cate whether the problem is a local one, or indeed referred from elsewhere in the body. If one under- stands the rules of referred pain, then it can be seen that a client indicating medial knee pain with a vague wave of the hand around the area, is suffering from a different complaint to another client who indicated their medial knee pain with the pointing of one ﬁn- ger."}
{"id": "1279", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "In the latter case, it is likely that local pathology is allowing the client to localise the sensation some- what more accurately than in the former case, where pain is referred to the knee from some pathology of the hip joint. Spread Linked to site of pain or symptoms, is that of spread. Ask the client: does their pain stay localised to the same area, or does it move in anyway?Again, knowl- edge of referred pain may further add to the evidence that the symptoms being experienced are from a re- ferred source more proximal to the site of perceived pain. Onset It is always useful to attempt to ﬁnd out what factors may have led to the onset of the client’s problem. Generally there are three forms of onset: gradual, sudden and insidious. The latter is a term that refers to an onset of unknown origin and can apply itself across both of the former two onsets (i.e. insidious gradual, or insidious sudden). Sudden onsets are usu- ally associated with trauma, and as such a “mech- anism of injury” may be established. Using sound anatomical and biomechanical knowledge, it may help to identify the tissues likely to be at fault caus- ing symptoms. Gradual onsets may be the result of overuse, or repeated trauma (e.g. tendonitis)."}
{"id": "1280", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Exam- ples of insidious insets may be pathologically more severe or even sinister; insidious gradual may be the onset of a tumour, insidious sudden may reﬂect a systemic problem such as gout. Duration This is an interesting one in that really it provides an idea of how likely you are to be able to change the client’s symptoms. Generally speaking, the longer someone has a condition, the less likely you are to be able to change or cure it. That does not mean to say that one should not attempt to change it; you may be the ﬁrst therapist to be approached about the condition, or the ﬁrst to accurately diagnose the problem. Behaviour What you are looking for here is: how do the symp- toms change during the day, are they constant, and what aggravates and indeed what eases them?Is there any diurnal variation?That is, what are the symptoms like ﬁrst thing in the morning, later in the day, at night?Conditions affecting the capsule and ligaments tend not to like extensive static peri- ods and feel “stiff” when ﬁrst moving, though feel better once moved. Tendonitis tends to be worse either during or after activity, whereas muscle le- sions hurt on movements that recruit that particular muscle. It is rare for symptoms such as pain from"}

Often, musculoskeletal pain is intermittent and movement dependant, and identify- ing what movements cause the onset of symptoms, and what positions, etc.cause relief, can help identify the tissue at fault. It may also help with provision of treatment in that someone who identiﬁes that move- ment and application of warmth helps their knee, it would seem unwise not to incorporate some kind of heat treatment and mobilisation or exercise into their treatment/rehabilitation programme. Symptoms The most obvious symptom here is pain; however, some clients complain of other sensations, such as locking, giving way, pins and needles (paraesthesia) and even numbness (anaesthesia). They may also complain of stiffness (as a symptom, as opposed to lack of range of motion – which you would measure as objective sign). There are many authors who have written about pain and the types of pain that peo- ple experience, and relate this to the various types of tissue that give pain (Butler, 1991, 2000; Travell and Simons 1992; Simons et al.1999). The fact that the pathophysiological mechanisms behind pain and its perception is so complex is further complicated when psychological inﬂuences are included (Butler 2000). This makes clinical reasoning of pain to be- come rather subjective and may lead to many oppor- tunities for misunderstanding."}
{"id": "1282", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "For example, clients have described the pain of sciatica as “being like a red-hot poker down the back of my leg”, or sharp knee pain, “feeling like I have been stabbed”. As both the client and the rehabilitator need to fully understand what is meant by such descriptions, and either or both may misinterpret what is really be- ing experienced, diagnosis based on such reasoning may be ﬂawed. It would seem to sufﬁce, therefore, when a client claims they have pain; objective and subjective examination will indicate the rest!Previous medical history Many therapists like to ask questions around this sub- ject earlier in the interview; however this may result in digging up matter that is really quite personal, so leaving it to the end allows you ﬁrst to establish rap- port with your client. Again, there are many things to consider here; ideally keep it reasonably simple. Several forms of treatment are contraindicated by the presence of certain conditions, and there are too many to consider at this stage of assessment (as you have no idea what treatments you wish to perform at this stage). Therefore, ask the client whether they have had any previous major operations, accidents or illnesses. The common response to this is a glib, “No”. It is useful to check and ask, “Are you sure?”This has the purpose of just getting the client to re- alise that this is an important question that requires careful consideration."}
{"id": "1283", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "This may well yield the same response; however, you are more likely to be able to trust this response in terms of accuracy. A good example of the reason for asking such questions is this: a female client complains of low back pain of insidious gradual nature, and in her past history re- veals she has had a hysterectomy. What needs to be established is why did she have a hysterectomy (was it due to cervical cancer – which can lead to spinal secondary metastases)?This can be ascertained by asking whether the client is still under the medical team for this, or has she been discharged (i.e. clear of the condition). This may help to change the potential worrying diagnoses of spinal cancer to one of remote possibility (note it does not dismiss the possibility). Medication Linked closely to past medical history is the question of medication. It may be useful to see if the client is taking any medication for the current condition, and whether or not it is beneﬁcial. However, it is also another way of establishing whether there are any other underlying illnesses or diseases not disclosed in the previous questions. As there are a plethora of possible medications that clients use, we are partic- ularly on the lookout for anticoagulants and long- term corticosteroid use. This is because in the case of the latter, ligaments and joints may become dam- aged by such medication; in the case of the former medication, potentially violent or high-impact treat- ment/rehabilitation processes may potentially cause bleeding that is not easy to stop (Grieve 1991)."}

One commonly used format for notes is the “SOAP” format, where this is divided into four sections: r subjective history r objective examination r assessment and analysis r plan The subjective section records the information re- garding age and occupation, site and spread, on- set and duration, behaviour and symptoms, and past medical history, whilst the objective section records evidence of deformity, colour changes, wast- ing, swelling, heat and ﬁndings from objective pas- sive and resistive tests. Recordings of the outcome of any special tests used would also be recorded here. It is always worth reporting negative outcomes to test, to show that they have been performed; how- ever, highlight in someway, all the highly signiﬁcant ﬁndings from the subjective and objective exami- nation, as this allows one to quickly identify the salient points when reviewing the same client in the future. The assessment section would allow the rehabil- itator to consider the diagnosis (or diagnoses in the case of multiple problems), and attempt to identify the status of the client and the probable prognosis. Indications of the severity and irritability would be useful here too. It may also be appropriate to con- sider short-term and long-term aims of treatment. For example, an athlete with an acutely sprained ankle may require taping or strapping and swelling control as short-term goals, whilst requiring gait re- education, proprioception and sport-speciﬁc training as long-term goals. By creating a clear intention of how and why to treat, allows the rehabilitator quickly to review their aims of treatment. Together with the previously highlighted ﬁndings from the subjective and objective assessment, this allows the rehabilita- tor to establish a treatment plan that is logical and effective."}

Successful rehabilitation of sports in- juries is dependent on a progressive plan that ad- dresses and accommodates the injury/pathological issues and conditions. In so doing, the rehabilita- tion plan incorporates a multitude of decisions and actions, often underpinned by research evidence. This chapter will explore these issues in relation to progressive rehabilitation by examining the con- cepts and principles of sports rehabilitation. The main issue and consideration speciﬁc to the de- velopment of a progressive rehabilitation plan is the careful and logical inclusion of objective cri- teria. These criteria allow the practitioner to con- sider how and when, to either progress or regress the rehabilitation in relation to the athlete’s needs and goals. Figure 12.1 details the components for progressive rehabilitation planning by considering questions necessary for the successful development of the rehabilitation programme and the logical se- quencing of the progressive rehabilitation exercise regime. Understanding progressive rehabilitation, assessment and observation On initial observation of an injury it is essential to perform an injury screening (refer to Chapter 2 for a detailed overview of screening procedures). SINS (severity, irritability, nature and stage) and SOAP notes (subjective, objective, assessment and plan) are two acronyms that provide an effective method of gathering information relating to possible trauma (Sleszynski et al.1999)."}

Previous research linked to isoki- netic muscle testing, which isolates a target muscle, has stated hip musculature is responsible for optimal functional single leg activity; however, fatigue does not occur in a single muscle group when performing closed kinetic chain exercises, which simulate move- ment patterns more likely to be carried out during everyday actives and athletic performance (Reimer and Wikstrom 2009). Similarly, deﬁcits in muscu- lar strength have been shown to increase the risk of injury. Hollman et al. (2006) suggest that reduced isometric strength of the hip abductors in relation to the hip adductors is associated with malalignment of the lower extremity such as foot pronation and knee valgus. This may result in inadequate neuromuscu- lar control during functional movement increasing the risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury (ACL) (Hewett et al.2006)."}

It is the synthesis of knowledge coupled with clin- ical practice that best deﬁnes how and when to either progress or regress exercise patterns and routines. It would be useful to read the chapters on Clin- ical Reasoning (Chapter 16) and An Introduction to Periodisation (Chapter 9) along with this chapter to better aid understanding of exercise design and decision-making processes. Consideration and application of the concept of continual progression is useful as it provides the clinician with the ability to justify why speciﬁc ex- ercises have been prescribed and how best to regress or progress the exercises depending on the athlete’s development through the rehabilitation process. Dur- ing the ﬁnal stages of a rehabilitation programme it is important that the athlete performs exercises within their functional range, this involves performing exer- cises that initiate abnormal motor control and allow minimal mechanical sensitivity (Liebenson 2006). By ensuring exercises are performed within a func- tional range, this limits the possibility of re-injury (Stracciolini et al.2007). In addition to introduc- ing the athlete to functional exercise it is important to ensure that movements simulate the patterns of movement the athlete will eventually perform in their sport, this needs to include the relevant muscle ac- tions (concentric, eccentric, isometric), velocity of movement, force generation, power output and rate of force development. Muscle actions that relate to effective movement patterns in the athlete’s sport must be implemented during ﬁnal stages of rehabilitation. For example, the hamstring muscle complex is a commonly injured re- gion of the body in relation to sports injury (Brockett et al."}

The demands of various sports often lead to trauma developing in different regions of the ham- string complex. For instance, in sprinters it has been shown that injury consistently occurred in the long head of the biceps femoris; in contrast dancers suf- fered common trauma at the proximal tendon of the semimembranosus. Return to pre-injury level was shown to be shorter for high-speed trauma as expe- rienced by the sprinters, in contrast to trauma result- ing from overstretching from which the dance group demonstrated (Askling et al.2008). This evidence provides information that shows rehabilitation from hamstring trauma particularly, should consider both the type of sport in which the athlete participates and the common movement patterns in preparation for implementation of a sports-speciﬁc functional reha- bilitation programme designed to prevent re-injury. This protocol should apply directly to any injury, to ensure successful management and long-term pro- tection against chronic and ongoing injury concerns.

They prescribe the following proto- col: “10 minutes ice/water submersion (approx 0◦) on 10 minutes off (room temperature) 10 minutes on ice/water submersion (approx 0◦)”. The submer- sion may also help with increased pressure and in turn mimic compression effects. The sport rehabil- itator is advised to adhere to prescribed guidelines for the use of cryotherapy within progressive injury rehabilitation. These could include the responsible use of cryotherapy, to prevent ice burns that may be caused by direct application or prolonged exposure to cryotherapy. The use of a wet cotton towel similar to that of a dish cloth may act as a suitable barrier between ice and skin (Bleakly et al.2007). Early intervention of the use of cryotherapy has also been suggested to help speed recovery and return to sport (Hubbard and Denegar 2004), therefore highlighting the importance of early cryotherapy use within the management of an injury. According to Hubbard and Denegar (2004), this ﬁeld of applied study and practice would beneﬁt from evidence-based research into the use and barri- ers of cryotherapy application. This has further been supported by Collins (2008), who claims that the evidence behind cryotherapy is insufﬁcient to the outcomes to improve the outcomes of clinical man- agement of soft tissue injuries."}

This can then be used to develop a speciﬁc stretching pro- gramme with the goal to enable the athlete restore full ROM to allow progression through the appropri- ate rehabilitative exercises and eventually to return to full sports participation (Beam 2002). It is important to ensure that prior to progressing rehabilitative exercises and return sport the athlete has sufﬁcient ROM at the joint enabling full capac- ity of movement to perform the exercises and to perform the sport-speciﬁc movements. The athlete must have pain-free active ROM in the frontal, sag- gital and transverse planes when performing basic movements and have the ability to contract the af- fected muscle in synergy with the antagonist muscles (Liebenson 2006).

Passive range of motion occurs when the clinician takes the affected limb through its range in order to provide information regarding the integrity of joint or ‘end feel’. This usually provides impor- tant information regarding the client’s condition and informs the clinician about future action, assessment and intervention. In considering normal joint range of motion, resultant injury risk factors and how to relate the importance of full functional range of mo- tion to the athlete’s movement patterns in their sport, the clinician can appreciate the relationship between the latter stages of the rehabilitation process and the return of an athlete to a competitive environment (Pizzari et al.2008). The athlete should not return to full activity until full pain-free functional range has been established (Stracciolini et al.2007). As ﬂexi- bility is an expression of range of motion, knowing when and how to incorporate ﬂexibility training into range of motion rehabilitation is important.

Once it is appropriate to begin stretching the mus- cle, that is, elongating the tissue beyond its avail- able range then careful passive stretching can be performed. Each stretch should be held at the end of available range within the limits of pain. Time, frequency, duration and intensity of stretch remain debateable in the literature. Some research suggests passive stretching should be held for a minimum of 15 seconds with 6–8 sets per day (Roberts and Wilson 1999), however, Bandy et al. (1994, 1997) reviewed stretches at 15 seconds, 30 seconds and 60 seconds. They determined that 30 seconds was the optimum duration (ideally repeated 3 times and performed 3 times per day), also stating that longer periods after 30 seconds was ineffective in promot- ing additional stretch. As with strengthening exercises stretching exer- cises need to be progressed in order that the tissue adapts to the different types of load once the athlete is comfortable (pain free) with passive stretching (Bandy et al.1994, 1997)."}

PNF has also been linked to a decrease in power production immediately post stretching (Mareket al.2005). Therefore it is essen- tial that ROM is restored as early in the rehabilitation process as possible to ensure that this does not have a detrimental effect on subsequent strength or power performance. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation is a form of muscle energy technique (MET) performed pas- sively with a partner involving a voluntary isometric contraction followed by a static stretch phase (Smith and Fryer 2008). There are two main PNF tech- niques; contract-relax and contract relax-antagonist contract techniques (Olivo and Magee 2006)."}

As the limb does not move, but the muscle contracts and therefore shortens, the change in length is accommodated by a lengthening of the tendons. This lengthening of the tendon stimulated the GTO and thereby inhibits the agonist. Once the isometric contraction ends the ROM can be increased and the procedure repeated. The contract relax-antagonist contract technique has been suggested as the most effective in increasing muscle length due to the concept of reciprocol inhi- bition, which produces increased suppression of the motor pool (Etnyre and Abraham 1986). Reciprocal inhibition is the relaxation that occurs in the oppos- ing muscle that is experiencing increased muscular tension (Olivo and Magee 2006). This is performed with a voluntary isometric contraction of the desired muscle to be stretched lasting approximately 7–10 seconds at a range of 25–40% of maximal volun- tary contraction (MVC) followed by an antagonist assisted static stretch phase (Olivo and Magee 2006; Smith and Fryer 2008).

Self myofascial release (SMR) Self myofascial release (SMR) is a soft tissue technique centred on enhancing ROM through the breakdown of myofascial restrictions in the body’s fascial system (Curran et al.2009). Fascia is a three- dimensional web of connective tissue that envelopes the body’s soft tissue from head to toe providing stability and ﬂexibility (Barnes 1997; Myers 1997). SMR is performed by slowly applying a force with the use of a foam roller to tender spots of the muscle (Curran et al.2009), which are indicative of fascially restricted areas termed “trigger points” (Travell and Simons 1992; Simons et al.1998). The force is main- tained for a time period ranging from 20 to 90 sec- onds or until a signiﬁcant reduction in discomfort is attained."}

When attempting to enhance ROM at a joint with ﬂexibility training it is important to not only address the muscles that are displaying reduced extensibility but also the synergistic muscles that are underac- tive or weak and therefore reducing active ROM. In this case, strengthening at the ends of the ROM is required. Proprioception/neuromuscular control As suggested by Myer et al. (2005) neuromuscular control training is important to the improvements of athletic performance and biomechanical stability, which in turn reduces the risk of injury. Proprioception is a term used frequently during rehabilitation and can be deﬁned as a specialised variation of the sensory system of touch that encom- passes the sensation of joint movement (kinesthe- sia) and joint position (joint position sense) (Lephart et al.1997). These signals are transmitted to the spinal cord via afferent (sensory) pathways (Prentice 2004)."}

Two motor control mechanisms are involved with interpreting afferent information and coordi- nating efferent responses (Dunn et al.1986; Prentice 2004), feed-forwards and feedback. Feed-forward neuromuscular control involves planning movements based on sensory informa- tion from past experience (La Coix 1981; Dunn et al.1986). Feedback process continuously regu- lates muscle activity through reﬂex pathways. Feed- forward mechanisms are for preparatory muscle activity; feedback processes are associated with re- active muscle activity.

Mechanorecep- tors (Pacinian corpuscles, Meissner corpuscles and free nerve endings) can be classiﬁed as either quick adapting (QA) or slow adapting (SA). Quick adapt- ing receptors cease discharging shortly after the on- set of a stimulus, whereas SA continue to discharge as long as the stimulus is present (Clark and Burgess 1975; Schultz et al.1984; Katonis et al.1991; Grigg 1994). In a healthy joint these QA mechanoreceptors are believed to provide conscious and subconscious kinaesthetic sensation in response to a joint move- ment or acceleration, whilst SA mechanoreceptors provide continuous feedback (Freeman and Wyke 1966; Clark and Burgess 1975) and therefore proprioceptive information relative to the joint position (Freeman and Wyke 1966; Clark and Burgess 1975; Schultz et al.,1984; Katonis et al.,1991; Grigg 1994).

Such a programme is highly recommended to promote dynamic joint and functional stability (Lephart et al.1997). There are different proprio- ceptive states that are important to consider in the design of a progressive rehabilitation programme. Static proprioceptive development involves exer- cises with the maintenance of a stable base, while allowing for only minimal movement. During this stage of neuromuscular development the athlete should focus on control of posture and be able to perform a number of modiﬁcations of static proprio- ceptive training before progressing on to a dynamic, more functional proprioceptive training programme (Liebenson 2006). Dynamic proprioceptive training should only be introduced when the athlete has demonstrated a suf- ﬁcient level of balance and coordination during the static proprioceptive exercise phase of the neuro- muscular control program (Beam 2002). Since dy- namic proprioceptive exercises involve greater lev- els of instability and require a higher demand for accuracy, strength and speed of motion (Myer et al.2006), balance and coordination are important to ensure the athlete can progress safely without hin- dering their development. A simple objective test to determine the athlete’s progression from static to dy- namic exercises can include the Romberg test which assesses the ability to balance."}

Continual adaptation to sports speciﬁc, functional balance training is fundamental to enhancing an ath- lete’s proprioceptive awareness. As a result of propri- oceptive training, receptors in soft tissue structures and joint complexes are trained to perform coherent actions, able to initiate dynamic, functional move- ments (Komi 2003).

By continuing to enhance the athletes neuro- muscular development the clinician is allowing for adaptive changes to occur within the neuromuscular system. This can lead to increases in the ability of an athlete to perform plyometric based exercises, increased levels of balance and improve leg co- ordination in sprint drills (Cameron et al.2007). Therefore, appropriate progressions during neuro- muscular control training will prepare the athlete to progress their rehabilitation on to effective plyomet- ric training. To implement an effective neuromuscular control programme the clinician should have an expansive knowledge of the anatomical structures and entire kinetic chain. Knowledge of the speciﬁc demands and common mechanisms of injury associated with the athlete’s sport will also aid in reducing the risk of injury and preventing the re-occurrence of a previous trauma. The clinician should be able to effectively adapt a neuromuscular programme without the risk of the onset and formation of muscle imbalances, which in turn may lead to musculoskeletal dysfunction and subsequent injury. For example, decreased neuromuscular control of the trunk can increase the risk of knee injury, speciﬁcally anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury (Zazulak et al.2007)."}

The altered neuromuscular activation of the ham- strings and quadriceps muscles are believed to play an important role in this risk of ACL injury. Since the hamstrings insert onto the posterior aspect of the tibia and ﬁbular head, they provide a posterior draw force on the knee that resist anterior tibial forces (Bryant et al.2008). However, if there are deﬁcits in muscle activation of the hamstrings there is a lim- ited ability to protect the knee ligaments (Hewett et al.2006). Consequently, over-dominant quadri- ceps activation as a result of under active hamstrings is believed to produce anterior displacement of the tibia, increasing the risk of ACL injury (Grifﬁn et al.2006). This is a commonly neglected stage of knee reha- bilitation that is of particular importance since ACL injury is one of the most common causes of reduced sport participation and is associated with recurrent injury and an increased risk of osteoarthritis of the knee (Walden et al."}

As a result, in order to maintain optimal dy- namic stability, effective proprioceptive input is nec- essary to ensure neuromuscular deﬁcits do not im- pair the athletes’ functional ability (Wassinger et al.2007). This is achieved by enhancing sensory motor con- trol and ability of the muscles to respond to a neural stimulus (Roig-Pull and Ranson 2007).

The cause of functional instability of the ankle is likely due to altered neuromuscular feed- back, which changes the neuromuscular response within the appropriate musculature (Coughlan and Caulﬁeld 2007). Therefore, great emphasis should be placed on incorporating neuromuscular control/proprioceptive exercises in the athletes’ rehabilitation programme in order to restore and improve balance, coordina- tion and agility thus increasing functional ability of the effected limb and the entire kinetic chain (Subasi et al.2008). Non-injured athletes can also perform neuromuscular control training during their weekly routine training sessions as part of a injury pre- vention training programme (Paterno et al.2004; Pasanen et al.2008) Basic concepts of application As with all stages of injury rehabilitation and the planning of exercise conditioning, the development of a neuromuscular control programme too is also dependant on many factors including gender, injury status, type of sport and level of competition. Since the aim of a proprioceptive training programme is to promote balance, coordination and agility accord- ingly (Subasi et al.2008), the athlete must begin ﬁrst with static exercises before progressing to dy- namic exercises. The exercises must develop from simple to complex with emphasis placed on preci- sion, accuracy and control."}

Consequently it has been shown that this may not only enhance performance potential in a competitive sporting environment, but further play a signiﬁcant role in injury prevention (Hewett et al.2005; Chappell and Limpisvasti 2008; McKeon and Hertel 2008; Twomey et al.2008; Zazulak et al.2007). It may also be more beneﬁcial to the athlete to perform proprioceptive exercises during the beginning of a rehabilitation session or before a training routine, particularly if the proprioceptive exercises are new to the athlete or are part of more advanced progressions. The reason for this is that it has been shown that exercise induces fatigue on the mechanoreceptors that are situated in the mus- culature surrounding the joint (McLean et al.2007)."}

Practical implementation of unstable surface training The importance of unstable surface training (UST) has been shown to be beneﬁcial in enhancing propri- oceptive input, enabling neuromuscular adaptations to commence during the early stage rehabilitation process (Cressey et al.2007). This form of training has been commonly implemented worldwide with a wide range of products. However, the key considera- tion is whether this form of training should continue throughout the athlete’s rehabilitation. In the latter stages when optimisation of force production and power output are required an unstable surface will result in a decrease in force and power output, as illustrated from the results of Cressey et al.2007). The majority of sporting movements in the upper extremity occur in an open chain manner; therefore it may be more beneﬁcial to incorporate unstable surface based exercises under these circum- stances, rather than in the lower extremity. Most ath- letic movements in the lower limb occur in a closed chain fashion, in which unstable surface training may prove detrimental to performance in relation to re- duced power output."}

The question of when best to implement a dy- namic proprioceptive programme remains contro- versial. Research has yet to fully support arguments surrounding pre versus post training sessions. The important factor to consider here is the inﬂuence of continuous eccentric muscle contractions on per- formance caused from over exertion (Lavender and Nosaka 2007). Intermittent high-intensity eccentric training causes micro-trauma within muscle ﬁbres (Clark et al.2005). The breakdown of ﬁbres within the skeletal muscle causes slight alterations in the ability of proprioceptive responses to interact ef- fectively with the central nervous system to initi- ate effective movement patterns in multi-directional planes of motion. Strength endurance and maximal strength To initiate a systematic rehabilitation approach through the strength phase it is important to under- stand the reasons behind why a progressive approach is demanded and how the beneﬁts of strength train- ing can relate to improved performance for an athlete on their return to sport. It is imperative to ensure athletes progress through the rehabilitation process establishing an adequate level of muscular endurance and then strength (Jarvinen et al."}

Isometric strength training needs to be consid- ered in the initial rehabilitation phase, and is often implemented 3–7 days post injury (Jarvinen et al.2007), usually with a focus on preventing muscle atrophy and/or a loss of strength. Frequency, dura- tion and intensity are limited by the patients’ pain. Some therapists advocate three sets of 10 repetitions using 5–10 second holds to begin with at intensity within pain tolerance (Pull and Ranson 2007). These then are undertaken at multiple angles, beginning in mid range then progressing to inner range (shortened position) then outer range (lengthened position). The sports rehabilitator should continue to moni- tor the progress of the athlete taking into considera- tion exercise frequency, intensity and duration. Early phase strengthening exercises, involve an isometric contraction of the agonist muscle with no movement at the joint. The contraction should be performed at different joint angles to initiate muscle ﬁbre activa- tion in different planes of motion. The stabilising force surrounding the joint is the antagonist muscle (Middleton and Smith 2007)."}
{"id": "1340", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Pain management and the acknowledgement of pain free training should be considered simultaneously with the implementation of strength training protocols. This is evident within the isometric strength development, where the pri- mary goal is to create an adaptive response in the muscle, without stressing the joint to excess (Lieben- son 2006). Once an athlete is able to perform isomet- ric muscle contractions at various joints without the onset of pain, it may then be advisable to progress the athlete onto dynamic exercises (Newberry and Bishop 2006). Sports rehabilitators must ensure that the athlete has full bilateral range of motion, no swelling or pain prior to implementation of pro- gressive, dynamic, functional based activity (Beam 2002). During isotonic exercise the athlete must provide a force powerful enough to initiate concentric and ec- centric muscle actions, whilst coping with a constant external load. There are different isotonic exercises that could be embedded into the rehabilitation pro- cess. These can include use of dumbbells, machine weights, and resistance bands (Beam 2002). Muscle injuries are associated with preferential at- rophy of type 1 muscle ﬁbres with disuse (Stockmar et al.2006), and high loads and rates of force de- velopment are most likely to over stress the healing tissue. Therefore, initially an endurance based pro- gramme should be used (3 sets of ≥15 repetitions at 40–60% of one repetition maximum) this should be progressed to strength (4–6 sets of 3-6 repetitions at 85–95% of one repetition maximum and then power training (3–5 sets of 3–5 repetitions at 75–85% of one repetition maximum) (Kraemer et al."}

A key consideration during the progression of isotonic training is the velocity at which the movement is performed (Wrbaskic and Dowling 2007). Initially the athlete should perform slow and controlled movements in order to allow for increased neural response to the working muscles and the continued development of neuromuscular control. Once the athlete is able to control the exer- cise effectively the continual progression to sports speciﬁc, functional activity coupled with changes in velocity, increased load and use of different planes of motion, should be considered (Liebenson 2006).

Figure 12.5 illustrates three primary phases of the GAS, which incorporate the initial response or alarm phase, the adaptive response phase and the exhaus- tion or plateau phase of a resistance or aerobic con- ditioning programme. The alarm phase often occurs following the introduction of a new stimulus into a training programme and can lead to the onset of de- layed onset muscular soreness (DOMS), joint stiff- ness and a general feeling of discomfort following a training session (Brown 2007). The resistance phase is when training adaptations occur and the muscles are able to respond effectively to the physiological changes within the body (Newton 2006). This phase tests the ability of the body to withstand various mechanical forces, which may ultimately lead to in- creased neuromuscular function within the trained musculature. If, however, training continues with- out the appropriate introduction of a new stimulus the exhaustion phase is emphasised (Epley 2004). This can result from too high a volume of training or progressions in intensity that are too large or rapid, resulting in a poorly prescribed and/or implemented training regime. The general adaptation syndrome is useful when designing and deciding on how best to progress or regress exercise intensity."}

Sports such as netball, tennis, squash, American football and basketball all require explo- sive movements in multiplanar directions, and would therefore beneﬁt directly from exercises that incor- porate high-velocity actions. However, in relation to progressive rehabilitation it is still imperative to en- sure the athlete attains isometric strength prior to continued progression through the strength training Alarm Initial  adaptive response Soreness, stiffness and decrease in performance Resistance Adapts to stimulus efficiently Optimal functioning  Exhaustion Decrease ability to adapt to stimulus Fatigue and injury Figure 12.6 Schematic diagram of genaral adaptation syndrome."}

Once adequate concentric strength has been devel- oped, it is essential to ensure that both the velocity of the concentric exercises and the emphasis on eccen- tric strength are developed. Evidence suggests that eccentric training during rehabilitation reduces the risk of recurring injuries, but used prior to injury re- duces the occurrence of injury (Askling et al.,2003; Mjolsnes et al.,2004; Clark, et al.,2005; Brooks et al.2006; Gabbe et al.2006; Arnason et al."}
{"id": "1345", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2008). Eccentric loading, especially at high velocities such as during plyometric training, may lead to signiﬁcant muscle damage, especially if there has been limited muscular endurance and strength train- ing (Schache et al.2008), resulting in delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). The rehabilitation pro- cess depends on the progress of each individual and therefore must be adapted as required. It is important that the clinician continues to monitor the progress of the athlete and ascertains when to enhance the pro- prioceptive and strength capacity of the individual (Gokaraju et al.2008). Training for muscular strength and endurance must cover all areas of the force velocity curve (Figure 12.7), usually progressing from isometric focused, through to concentric and eccentric, begin- ning at low velocities and progressing through to high velocity activities. Plyometric training In order to appreciate the importance of plyometric training as part of a sport speciﬁc rehabilitation pro- gramme, the components of athletic movement need to be considered (Epley 2004). All sports and ath- letic movements require the optimum functioning of active muscles to produce muscular forces at vary- ing speeds through multiple planes of motion. This is known as the force-velocity relationship and can be used to describe the term power."}
{"id": "1346", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Power is present in all sports or activities in- volving rapid force production (Brown et al.2007). Plyometric training is a form of resistance training that involves high-velocity based exercises charac- terised by quick eccentric (lengthened) muscle con- tractions followed by rapid concentric (shortened) muscle contractions. This is achieved through a process termed the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) (Shiner et al.2005). These exercises enhance power production by increasing motor-unit recruitment, rate of muscle ﬁring and sensitivity and excitabil- ity of the neuromuscular system, thereby promoting optimum neuromuscular efﬁciency (Newberry and Bishop 2006). Plyometric activities also take advan- tage of the elastic components of the tissues (ten- dons, muscles and fascia) along with the increased motor recruitment due to the stretch reﬂex. Plyometric training offers a progressive approach to incorporating functional sport speciﬁc movements"}

Before commencing a plyometric programme the athlete must be assessed for the appropriate com- ponents of lumbo-pelvic (core) stability and neuro- muscular control (especially during ground contact), including optimum functional movement that will enable the required rate of muscle contraction whilst reducing the risk of potential injury. Constant obser- vational assessments should be conducted, such as postural assessments and lower limb control during landing. In addition to optimum kinematics, the ath- lete must also possess appropriate components of strength, proprioception and ROM (Chmielewski et al."}
{"id": "1348", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2006). Adequate levels of strength will en- able the athlete to perform the exercises with sufﬁ- cient control minimising the risk of injury. Strength requirements vary depending on the particular ex- ercise, for example Chu (1998) suggests that levels of strength require the athlete to perform a squat with at least 60% of their body weight for ﬁve rep- etitions in no less than ﬁve seconds in order to en- sure adequate velocity during the concentric phase of loading. The landing or loading phase of plyomet- ric exercise is particularly important as it initiates the stretch-shortening cycle and subsequent force production (Rassier and Herzog 2005). As a result, prior to full plyometric training, emphasis should be placed on perfecting the landing component with the use of technique based drills. This should have already been addressed during earlier stages of reha- bilitation that focused on neuromuscular control. Consequently, it has been suggested that plyomet- ric exercise can be implemented when the athlete can sustain moderate loading during basic strength- ening exercises with the ability to perform func- tional movement patterns efﬁciently (Chmielewski et al.2006). Balance, coordination and agility are important components of proprioception that will enable the athlete to control the explosive and inten- sive movements involved with plyometric training (Chmielewski et al.2006)."}
{"id": "1349", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "An appropriate level of ﬂexibility is also required in order to perform plyo- metrics. Flexibility is governed by the tissue exten- sibility at a joint, which in turn dictates the degree of range of motion (ROM) that is available at a joint during active movement (Bradley and Portas 2007). The velocity, force, muscle action and rate of load- ing can also be manipulated to suit the speciﬁc de- mands of the athlete’s sport (Shiner et al.2005). Fre- quent functional evaluations will provide the appro- priate feedback on whether to regress or progress the athlete’s exercises. This will result in a progressive and systematic, goal orientated plyometric exercise programme. Plyometric training should also be progressive and periodised to allow progression in terms of increas- ing velocity of movement or deceleration forces, de- pending on the aims of the athlete and the require- ments of the sport. At the same time it is essential to continue with some strength training to prevent a detraining effect and therefore a loss of strength. Pro- gression for sport-speciﬁc activities should develop from unidirectional, to bidirectional, to multidirec- tional movements (Heidt et al.2000)."}

Collaboration between the strength and conditioning staff and the rehabilitator(s) generally ensures that the athlete is not only appropriately prepared for a return to sport in terms of their injury, but also in terms of their physical conditioning and ﬁtness. Appropriate conditioning is essential not only to optimise performance, but also to reduce the risk of injury. Research has demonstrated that strength and conditioning training not only improves per- formance in strength, power and speed related sports and activities (Wilsoff et al.2004; Cronin and Hansen 2005; Hori et al.2008), but also in endurance-based sports and activities (Paavolainen et al.1999; Spurrs et al.2002; Turner et al.2003). There is also a large body of evidence that has found that certain methods of strength and condi- tioning training can reduce injury risk (Ford et al."}

The aim of this chapter is to highlight the different methods of strength and conditioning that are com- monly used (emphasised) during different phases of a progressive, periodised training programme, and to summarise the adaptive responses that can be ex- pected from each mode of training. The chapter then progresses on to a summary of how appropriate in- terventions within a strength and conditioning pro- gramme may reduce the risk of injury, and assist in the later stages of a rehabilitation programme, and effectively reduce the risk of re-injury. In order to fully appreciate the concepts presented in this chapter, this should be studied in conjunction with the chapter on periodisation (Chapter 9)."}

For example, a sprinter does not have time to produce maximal strength in the short period it takes to leave the blocks at the start of a race. Success in the start depends on an- other attribute of strength; in this case the magnitude of force that can be produced quickly. The best ath- letes are not always the strongest but are often the most explosive. Even in highly skilled games like soccer, explosive ability (assessed by short sprint and jumping performance) can differentiate between levels of success (Brewer and Davis 1991; Kollath and Quade 1993). Explosive strength is often re- ferred to as power, which is deﬁned as the rate of performing work. The faster any given weight is lifted (or other resistance overcome) the greater the power.

Each of these methods produces adaptations that are speciﬁc to the attributes trained. For example, heavy resistance training stimulates the development of maximal strength (power- lifting); power training develops force application at high velocities (throwing and jumping events); explosive isometric training develops rate of force development at low velocities (sprint start) (Kubo et al.2001); and eccentric emphasised training de- velops rapid eccentric strength which may decrease the risk of injury during deceleration and agility drills. Explosive force production Few sports rely exclusively on maximal strength. Of these, the most notable sport that does rely on strength is Powerlifting, where performance of the bench press, dead lift and squat is exclusively depen- dent on an athlete’s ability to produce force. Pow- erlifting therefore depends more on strength than power. In contrast, success in most other sports depends on explosive force production, or power, which in turn depends on both the magnitude of force pro- duced (strength) and the rate at which it is applied (speed)."}
{"id": "1384", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Of these, it is often the rate of force devel- opment that is more important to sporting success than the magnitude of force developed. For exam- ple, in the athletic throwing events it is not the heav- iest lifters who throw the discus, shot, hammer, and javelin the furthest, but it is often the most explo- sive. The most common methods of training for the development of power include Olympic style lifting, plyometrics and complex training. Whilst there is a relationship between maxi- mal strength and power-based performance such as sprinting and jumping (Wilsoff et al.2004; Cronin and Hansen 2005), strength alone does not determine success. Rather it is the proportion of that strength that can be utilised quickly and the efﬁciency with which that strength is integrated into sport-speciﬁc movement patterns. For example, a rookie shot putter may possess all the explosiveness necessary for elite performance, but if the power cannot be generated in sport-speciﬁc movement patterns and harnessed through correct technique then they will not achieve full potential. Training must be designed such that any gains in strength transfer to improved perfor- mance. Rate of force development Sporting movements occur quickly, often between 30 and 200 ms. The length of the contact time during maximal sprinting is between 70 and 125 ms (Kunz and Kaufmann 1981; Mann and Herman 1985; Moravec et al."}

Therefore, prior to competition, training should focus on maximising the force that can be developed quickly (increasing rate of force development). The quicker a sprinter can generate force then the faster they will be. Figure 13.1 represents the strength characteristics of two athletes. Athlete B clearly has the highest force production and can be considered the stronger of the two athletes. Athlete A, however, has a greater rate of force development (RFD) and is stronger than athlete B in the initial stages of contraction (up to point C). The arrows D and E represent the dif- ferences in force production between athlete A and athlete B at 125ms and 200ms respectively. As most sporting movements require explosive force produc- tion within the ﬁrst 200ms then athlete A can be considered as better conditioned for their sport, and should be more successful. If, however, the athlete was a power lifter, or rugby forward, where pro- duction of maximal strength of a longer duration determines success in a lift or scrum respectively, then athlete B can be considered as better condi- tioned for their sport and should be more successful.

Of course, it is both the magnitude as well as the rate of force development that is essential. For example, Weyand et al. (2000) found that faster running speeds were attributed to greater ground reaction forces, rather than increases in limb speed. Training to maximize RFD Rate of force development is best enhanced by train- ing explosive movements where the intention is to accelerate the resistance (either a bar, medicine ball, or the body) as quickly as possible. Slow heavy exer- cises increase strength (and therefore the maximum force athletes can produce), but do not increase the force development within the ﬁrst 200ms of con- traction, required by sport in conditioned athletes (Hakkinen and Komi 1985; Zatsiorsky 1995), al- though very heavy resistance exercise can increase RFD within the ﬁrst 200ms, in individuals who have not previously participated in structured resistance training, via enhanced neural drive (Aagaard et al.2002). It is worth noting, however, that all of these types of training play their role within a well devel- oped periodised training programme. Figure 13.2 represents the RFD characteristics of untrained, heavy-resistance trained, and explosive- ballistic trained athletes."}
{"id": "1387", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Note that the heavy- resistance trained athletes have a higher maximum strength, but take up to 500ms to develop this strength. Explosive-ballistic trained athletes, how- ever, can generate greater force within the 200ms timeframes typically encountered in sport. It is there- fore essential that a complete rehabilitation pro- gramme prepares the athlete for such demands, rather than concentrating on isometric strength, or low velocity concentric strength as with most ‘tra- ditional’ rehabilitation programmes. In a periodised model the heavy training should precede the explo- sive training. Although explosive-ballistic training is effective at improving rate of force development and strength in the initial stages of muscle action (up to 200ms), it is still possible to focus training even more accu- rately. For example, during a sprint, ground con- tact times, and therefore the time over which an athlete can generate useful force, change through- out the race. At the beginning of the race, when the athlete drives out of the blocks and acceler- ates for the ﬁrst few strides, the ground contact time can be greater than 340 and 200ms respec- tively(Mero1988),whereaswhentheathletereaches peak running velocity, the contact time is nearer to 70–125ms.

For example, if an athlete accelerates well for the ﬁrst few metres but cannot compete at the faster speeds then they will beneﬁt from training that focuses on shorter ground contact times (short response or reactivity training) such as plyometrics. If an athlete has a high peak velocity but is slow when accelerating then they should focus on strength and power development over a longer ground con- tact time (long response training) such as weighted jump squats, Olympic lifts, or single leg hopping and bounding. (Single leg hopping has a ground contact time of approximately 230ms according to Aura and Viitasalo (1989).)This has a particular relevance for team sports where the ability to accelerate over the ﬁrst few metres may be far more important to suc- cess than peak running velocity. In soccer, sprints generally last between 12 and 22m (Bangsbo et al.1991; Drust et al.1998)."}

{"id": "1390", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "LONG RESPONSE TRAINING 227 Short response training – reactivity training Short response (reactivity) training is speciﬁcally de- signed to help athletes accept and produce forces over very short periods (typically 75–200ms). Short response training is therefore fundamental to max- imising sprinting speed and jumping ability as these activities require athletes to accept and produce ground reaction forces quickly. The best type of training for reactivity is plyometrics, focusing on those with a short ground contact time. Plyometric training involves very quick, light, yet powerful activities like quick feet, skips and low amplitude jumps. Emphasis should be placed on speed, maximising the rate of stretch, minimising ground contact time, and good technique, rather than height jumped, the height of the box jumped from and the length of the bound. Although the height of the subsequent jump does increase with increas- ing drop heights (due to an increase in the rate of stretch at landing) this only occurs up to a threshold height (Bosco and Komi 1979). Above this height, the rate of stretch is too high and the golgi ten- don organ (GTO) reﬂex inhibits muscle contraction (Schmidtbleicher et al.1988), lessening subsequent jump height. Training aimed at developing the reac- tive elements of muscle contraction should not use drop heights greater than this threshold. Although Kreighbaum and Katherine (1996) suggest a plat- form height of no more than 20cm to minimise the risk of injury, for many athletes the threshold occurs at heights much greater than this, although usually no higher than 60cm."}
{"id": "1391", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "It is also worth noting that plyometrics can be effectively performed in water (Robinson et al.2004; Stemm and Jacobson 2007), therefore reducing the impact forces, due to the buoy- ancy of the water, and allowing plyometric training to be introduced to athletes at an earlier stage in their development/rehabilitation. It is also interesting to note that plyometric train- ing has been shown to have a beneﬁcial effect on tendon and joint stiffness (Burgess et al.2007; Kubo et al.2007a), which may reduce the risk of injuries. The type and intensity of exercises incorporated into the training session will determine the number of repetitions performed. For example, mini-hurdle jumps, where the emphasis is on minimising ground contact after a relatively low drop height, can be per- formed in multiple sets (5) of high quantity (25), Table 13.1 Short response training Intensity Exercise Reps Sets Low Mini hurdle jumps, cone jumps, line jumps 25 5 Medium Hexagon drill, line hops 15–20 3 High Full hurdle jumps, depth jumps 6–10 3–5 high quality (rapid; short contact time) jumps. In contrast, full-hurdle jumps, where the athlete must clear a height of one metre with each jump, elicit a greater impact velocity and, therefore, higher im- pact forces on landing. To maintain the quality and intensity of movement, the number of repetitions should be kept low (four–eight). Higher intensity ex- ercises (single leg hops, or single leg depth jumps in well-conditioned athletes) may be limited to one to four quality repetitions per set."}

It is essential to remember that plyometric training places a high neurological demand on the athlete and is therefore most effective when athletes are well rested. Movements such as depth jumps, hopping, and bounding typically have longer ground contact times and come under the heading of long response training. Long response training Long-response training refers to the training of pow- erful explosive movements with a contact or appli- cation time of more than 200ms. By comparison with short response training long response training is characterised by greater amplitude of movement about the hip, knee, and ankle joints and also by the use of a greater external resistance. Whereas short-response training is dominated by quickness of movement, long response training is dominated more by strength. Long response movements include activities rang- ing in speed from faster activities of around 200ms (bounding, tire pulling, single leg hopping and depth jumping) to longer activities of up to 500ms (un- weighted squat jumps, one legged jump-squats and weighted jump squats). This type of training can en- hance force production, acceleration from a standing start and height jumped. Bosco (1982) found that the"}

Research has also demon- strated that including drop jumps (ﬁve jumps from a 60cm box) within a dynamic warm up result in an increase in subsequent power based activities (Hilﬁker et al.2007). It is essential that the training programme meets the physiological, biomechanical and metabolic requirements of the sport; these will be introduced later on in the chapter. Isometric training In contrast to the beneﬁcial effects of explosive training compared with heavy strength training, research has demonstrated that isometric training can also result in increases in RFD, power and vertical jump height, which is attributed to increases in tendon stiffness (Kubo et al.2001; Bojsen-Moller et al.2005; Kubo et al.2007b; Burgess et al.2007)."}
{"id": "1394", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "It is worth noting, however, that this type of isometric training must be performed with the intention of explosive movement, and should not be the sole method of training. It is generally incorporated into the ‘normal’ training session as a few additional sets. A key concept to understand is the force velocity relationship of skeletal muscles, applied to training methodologies and the requirements of sporting ac- tivities (see Figures 13.4 and 13.15). This includes both concentric and eccentric muscle actions that are responsible for acceleration and deceleration re- spectively, which therefore corresponds to improve- ments in agility. It is essential that these concepts are applied when identifying the mechanics of the sport/activity and integrated into the exercise selec- tion process. Intensity Overload This is usually referred to as ‘progressive overload’. More often, however, a form of ‘ﬂuctuating over- load’ (Figure 13.5) is applied as part of a periodised training programme (Siff 2004).

Figure 13.8 illustrates the principle of super-compensation from one training session. Timing The timing of the next training session is vital and varies according to the recovery abilities of the ath- lete and the demands imposed by the previous ses- sion. For example, a well-conditioned athlete can recover from a long training run within 24 hours (excluding the skeletal system), whereas the same athlete may take 10 days to recover from a heavy resistance training session involving rapid eccentric activities and supra-maximal loads. Once an athlete has adapted to a speciﬁc training load or stimulus (for example running ﬁve miles, three times per week at a constant pace), then fur- ther gains can only be made if the training load is increased. This is known as the principle of progres- sive overload. The runner (above) will not improve beyond the ﬁtness level needed to run ﬁve miles, three times per week, at that constant pace. Once that level of ﬁtness is achieved it will remain static. In order to improve their running ability further the stimulus must be increased.

During such situations, athletes are more susceptible to overtraining syndrome, injury and ill- ness. Adequate recovery is therefore essential to a successful training programme. It should be noted that there are times when ath- letes may perform successive hard training sessions in a block, without allowing full recovery. For a few days, the athletes accumulate fatigue. This shocks the system and gives an opportunity – with sufﬁcient recovery later – to stimulate further adaptations (Fig- ure 13.11), and can also be used when ensuring that an athlete peaks for a speciﬁc competition (Pistilli et al.2008). This is an advanced training method known as shock training (planned Overreaching) and should only be used by athletes who already have a solid training base.

There is often a ﬁne line between providing the opti- mum stimulus for adaptation and inducing a state of over-training and susceptibility to injury and illness. Adaptation potential An athlete’s adaptation potential (or capacity for improvement) is a function of both their genetic makeup and their current level of ﬁtness. Genetic makeup, an athlete’s ultimate potential for success, is ﬁxed and therefore not responsive to training (Brzycki 1989). The major factor determining an athlete’s adaptation potential then is their current state of ﬁtness relative to their genetic ceiling. The primary training aim of all athletes should be to fulﬁl their genetic potential. This is never easy. As athletes get ﬁtter and more skilled they ﬁnd it increas- ingly more difﬁcult to make further improvements – they get diminishing returns for their efforts. As they approach their genetic ceiling, further improvements become almost impossible (Figure 13.12)."}

In the medium term, however, such training will plateau, bad habits can form, and the athlete may not fulﬁl their true potential. It is crucial; therefore, that athletes and coaches adopt the same, thorough and careful approach to training programme design with all athletes, what- ever their age and training status. A well-designed programme in the early stages ultimately lays the foundation for future success. Training parameters The training parameters that contribute towards the overall training effect include: frequency, intensity, and duration of training sessions; the quality and quantity of rest between and during sessions; and speciﬁcity.

In ad- dition, strength improvements can occur within weeks; sport speciﬁc endurance may take weeks and months; and overall work capacity will only improve gradually over a period of months and years. Athletes and coaches must also be aware that different body systems adapt at different rates following training (see Table 13.4). For example, with strength training, the rate of adaptation of tendons and bones is slow compared to the rate of adaptation of muscle. The consequences of this are that muscles get stronger quicker and pull on tendons that are yet to adapt to the stresses of training. This leads to the potential for injury. Detraining All improvements in ﬁtness are reversible. What an athlete can gain with training, they can lose with de- training. When athletes stop or reduce their training, their body systems adjust accordingly. This presents as a loss of strength and power (Narici et al."}

Although detraining of strength and power is relatively slow (Colliander and Tesch 1992; Hortobagyi et al.1993), particu- larly with the inclusion of some eccentric exercise (Housh et al.1996), the detraining of endurance is more rapid with signiﬁcant effects noticed in days and weeks (Coyle et al.1986). Overall, the de-training effects of a short-term break (1–2 weeks) are relatively small, especially if physical activity levels remain high, however longer or more frequent periods of inactivity have a greater cumulative impact on overall ﬁtness. Thus, when athletes resume training after a layoff or injury, they cannot start at the level (intensity, duration or com- plexity) at which they left off. Care must therefore be taken when designing training sessions that occur after an injury or other long lay-off."}
{"id": "1407", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "In such cases, a gradual and progressive re-introduction to full train- ing will carry fewer risks of re-injury and produce more sustainable gains than other more intense meth- ods. Many athletes and coaches are keen to make up for lost time and consequently train too-hard, too- soon, risking both injury and possible over-training. It is far better, therefore, to minimise ﬁtness losses in the ﬁrst place. To minimise ﬁtness losses, injured athletes must examine strategies, within their treat- ment and rehabilitation, which enable them to con- tinue to exercise. One such strategy may involve the use of alternative low-risk activities that do not stress the injury. For example, rowing, stationary cycling and deep water running are all excellent methods of maintaining general cardiovascular ﬁtness when in- jured; strength training can be targeted towards key movements in non-injured areas; whilst propriocep- tion training of the non-injured limb can provide useful crossover beneﬁts to the injured limb. Specificity The most important element of functional condition- ing is the principle of speciﬁcity. The principle of speciﬁcity dictates that training should match the de- mands of the sport. Given that sport consists of many components – with successful athletes needing to start, stop, twist, turn, run, jump, land, shufﬂe, push, pull, hit, bend, throw, catch, hop, accelerate, decel- erate, slide, block, and barge, all within the ﬂuid, dynamic, and unpredictable environment of sport, and all without getting injured – we are presented with a complex problem. It is also worth noting, however, that open kinetic chain exercises, such as leg ﬂexion, have little effect on performance of sport speciﬁc movements (Augustsson et al."}

Training that does not relate directly to the move- ments and activity patterns found in sport, is a waste. Unfortunately, many athletes still employ training methods that are non-sport speciﬁc. These methods are often prescriptive, predictable and sterile. Many are based on one-size-ﬁts-all training systems re- ported to be the secret of another athlete’s success."}
{"id": "1409", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "SPECIFICITY 235 Many lack sufﬁcient variety, using repetitive sched- ules that soon lead to a plateau in performance. Most fail to account for the ﬂuid, unpredictable and three- dimensional nature of sport. In essence, they fail to stimulate athletes in a truly sport speciﬁc way. Despite the best intentions of coaches and athletes, too much conditioning time and energy is directed towards superﬂuous, non-speciﬁc activity. For example, when strength training, many athletes monitor their progress by how much they can squat or bench press, and focus training towards these ex- ercises. Sport, however, typically requires strength to be expressed in a faster, more dynamic, and in a three-dimensional fashion. Although a relationship has been demonstrated between squat strength and both sprint speed and vertical jump height (Wilsoff et al.2004), and heavy bench press appears to be an appropriate pre-load activity for performing com- plex training on functional movements (Matthews et al.2009), squatting and bench press alone do not prepare an athlete for all movement patterns required in sport. Too much training time devoted to non-functional movements takes training focus away from sports speciﬁc activities and causes extra fatigue, forcing the body to recover from training that does have a direct affect on performance."}
{"id": "1410", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "How- ever, the reverse is also true, where athletes spend too much time focusing on sports speciﬁc training and lack adequate strength and power development required to produce an increase in sports perfor- mance. Less sports speciﬁc movements, however, can provide a good solid base (general preparation phase) from which an athlete can progress to more speciﬁc conditioning (pre-competition and peaking phases) (see Chapter 9: An Introduction to Periodisation). To condition athletes effectively, training must mimic the conditions encountered in sport. To achieve this, programme designers must: (1) analyse the demands of the sport; (2) identify the individual characteristics of the athlete (strengths and weak- nesses; training history); and (3) tailor and prioritise training to allow each individual athlete to meet these speciﬁc demands. It is essential that the training programme is spe- ciﬁc in terms of the metabolic demands (energy sys- tems) (see Chapter 3; Needs Analysis section) and mechanical demands (muscle action, force, velocity, range of motion). Mechanical demands The mechanical demands of sport determine the movements that athletes should train. Exercises that mimic the actual movements encountered in sport should be prioritised. By focusing on movement pat- tern speciﬁcity athletes can reinforce and condition the actual motor programmes used in skilled perfor- mance. These programmes control the precise or- der, timing, velocity, force application and muscle action to enable the muscles to produce a predeter- mined movement (Enoka 1994). The more practiced and efﬁcient these programmes, the better the per- formance of the skill."}
{"id": "1411", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "For example, a rugby player who focuses practice on the foot patterns required to side step an opponent can enhance side-stepping performance by executing quicker, more efﬁcient motor programmes. However, it is also worth not- ing that if the athlete does not have the eccentric strength to enable them to decelerate, or the power to re-accelerate in another direction practising foot- work will have little effect. The best training for movement pattern speciﬁcity is to practice the actual skills involved in sport, how- ever, ensuring progressive overload in these activi- ties is not possible. Repetition of the skill is possible for many sports; however there are sports and sit- uations where it is not practical or safe to perform high volumes of the speciﬁc patterns, frequently. A triple-jumper or long-jumper, for example, who only trains by performing the actual jump skills would soon breakdown due to the constant repetition of in- tense impacts. For these athletes other, less intensive, methods should be used that mimic closely the actual movements involved. These methods focus on the ranges, speeds and forces encountered, allowing the development of ﬁtness attributes in a functional way that may ultimately allow athletes to tolerate more actual (jumping) practice. For example, heavy force- acceptance strength training, fast force-acceptance strength training, dynamic control and stabilisation training, along with speciﬁc jumping drills will in- crease an athlete’s capacity to tolerate actual skill practice in the highly intensive triple jump. The training methods that transfer best to ac- tual sporting performance usually involve coordi- nated movements across multiple joints rather than strict isolation exercises. In sport, no muscle works in isolation."}

Consideration of how to train movements, not muscles is essential. Training that focuses on the whole movement enhances functional performance more effectively than the training of isolated joint movements; integrate, don’t isolate. For example: A sprint start requires rapid and forceful triple extension of the hip, knee, and ankle, along with rapid ﬂexion at the shoulder on the same side and rapid extension on the opposite side, plus a torso that is rigid enough to control and transfer forces from one body segment to another. Athletes must therefore train movements that target these ar- eas. Multi-joint all-body dynamic movements that are uni-lateral or cyclic (one legged jump squats; split jump lunges) are far more speciﬁc than single joint bi-lateral isolation exercises performed slowly (leg extensions; leg curls). Traditional basic strength exercises, like back-squats and squat-jumps, may not be cyclical, but allow the athlete to focus on gener- ating maximal forces as explosively as possible, as required in the initial strides during a sprint start. They are sport speciﬁc in terms of being multi-joint triple extension exercises and forces generated, how- ever they are non-sport speciﬁc in terms of their velocity and their bi-lateral nature.

As previously mentioned it is essential to note that single joint exercises have little effect on performance of sports speciﬁc movements (Augustsson et al.1998; Blackburn and Morrissey, 1998; Augustsson and Thomee, 2000). Focusing training towards the actual mechanics of the movements (magnitude of force, direction of force, velocity of movement, muscle actions in- volved, level of stability required, etc.)required by sport is clearly paramount to optimal conditioning. In sport, however, success rarely relies on the ex- ecution of one single discreet movement; there are always other movements, either preceding or follow- ing the current one. One focus (and often neglected area) of training is training athletes to transfer ﬂu- idly and efﬁciently from one movement to another. In sport, no movement ever stands alone."}

Players must be ready to sprint or lunge to any point on the court to intercept the return ball. The follow through from a serve will merge with the next skill, and the more efﬁciently this occurs the quicker a player can inter- cept and play the next shot. Equally, if a tennis player can explode laterally from a sideways lunge position (a forehand on the edge of the court) then they stand a better chance of reaching the next shot. If prior to this, however, they exhibit inefﬁcient deceleration mechanics and poor force-acceptance going into the shot, then the whole movement will be slower. Success in sport, then, requires athletes to train in a sport speciﬁc way. By analysing the movement patterns (force, velocity, muscle action, joint angles) involved in sports and replicating those in training, athletes can not only develop strength, speed, power, endurance, and ﬂexibility in a truly functional way, but also integrate and perfect combinations of move- ments to replicate typical patterns of play. As well as training to produce force we must also focus on the athlete’s ability to accept force. Sport requires athletes to reduce and absorb external forces often at high speeds, in three dimensions, and in an unpredictable fashion.

Exercises, such as plyometrics, that incorporate fast eccentric loading in the initial phases and place a high demand on an athlete’s ability to dynamically stabilise their joints under varying conditions, also allows them to develop greater control and accept higher forces quickly. The other advantage is that training the speciﬁc movement patterns involved in sport motivates the Figure 13.14 Descent during Nordic hamstring lowers/curls.athlete by helping them see the relevance of the train- ing.

Injury prevention Avoidable versus unavoidable injuries There are two types of injuries: those that can be avoided through appropriate conditioning; and those that cannot. In situations where a high-velocity, high-energy collision coincides with a vulnerable joint position, injury is usually unavoidable.

Any injury that occurs without contact with other players may be avoided through correct conditioning. Injuries that occur when landing, twisting, or stopping are of- ten the result of inappropriate muscular activation and inefﬁcient mechanics of landing or deceleration, which may in turn be worsened under conditions of fatigue (see Table 13.5).

Sport speciﬁc rehabilitation provides a frame- work for athletes to bridge the gap between these traditional rehabilitation outcomes and the speciﬁc demands of sport, and involves a sequential pro- gression of ever more challenging and speciﬁc exer- cises. Athletes begin rehabilitation as soon as pos- sible post-injury and continue until full functional capacity (speciﬁc to the demands of their sports) is restored. At each stage, athletes will perform exer- cises appropriate to their level of healing, and their level of proprioception and control, whilst aiming to incorporate functional elements from their sport. In the early phases post-injury the exercises will be simple and predictable in nature, performed slowly, with minimal loading. In the later stages exercises will be complex, high velocity, high load, multiple plane and unpredictable. When designing rehabilitation, or conditioning programmes, coaches and rehabilitators must never lose sight of the speciﬁc demands imposed by the sport, including the ability to exhibit rapid and co- ordinated responses to the ever-changing environ- ments. For a comparison of approaches to rehabili- tation see Table 13.7 and Figure 13.16. References Aagaard, P., Simonsen, E. B., Magnusson, S. P., Larsson, B. and Dyhre-Poulsen, P.

It takes account of how nutrients are digested and absorbed and how foods are metabolised for energy or assimilated into body tissues. Correct nutrition, or more speciﬁcally the optimal balance of energy and nutrients delivered at the right time, has a range of potential beneﬁts for the athlete. These include: recuperation from and adaptation to training; the maintenance of work-rate throughout a match, race or training session; the maintenance of concentration and coordination; the maintenance of body composition; and provision of an optimum environment for injuries to heal. Without correct nu- trition, all of these processes are affected with as- sociated detriments to training, performance, injury risk and injury rehabilitation. During this chapter you will learn about: r fundamentals of nutrition r energy balance r the nutrients and how to obtain them r the importance of a balanced diet for health and performance r energy requirements for speciﬁc sports r nutritional strategies for optimal performance and the evidence to support them r nutritional strategies for injury prevention r nutrition for the injured athlete Fundamentals of nutrition Energy balance Food and drink provide energy. Complex chemical processes break down food to provide essential fuels for a range of functions including breathing, blood circulation, chemical reactions, growth, repair, brain function and muscular activity. Managing energy balance is a nutritional prior- ity for athletes."}

By contrast, a diet that has insufﬁcient energy will lead to weight loss. This may be the case in sports that require a high volume of training, such as triathlon, where athletes may struggle to consume enough energy to meet the demands of training. To maintain weight and body composition at the optimal level for sport, athletes must therefore man- age both the amount of energy they consume and the amount they expend."}
{"id": "1451", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "This is called managing the energy balance. Energy balance can be summarised by the follow- ing: If athletes consume more energy than they use then they will gain weight – hypercaloriﬁc diet. If athletes consume as much energy as they use then they will stay the same weight – isocaloriﬁc diet. If athletes consume less energy than they use then they will lose weight – hypocaloriﬁc diet (Figure 14.1). Energy and calories Energy is measured in Joules, however the term most often used in dietetics and amongst athletes is the kcal (one kcal equals 4.2 kJoules). To maintain en- ergy balance, the estimated average energy intakes required in ‘healthy’ adults are 2550 kcal/day for males and 1940 kcal/day for females (FSA 2008). Additional physical activity needs, however, are not accounted for in these estimated average require- ments. Therefore athletes in training will have higher energy requirements and this will increase in pro- portion to the volume of training that the athlete performs. Nutrients and where to get them In addition to energy, food and drink provide nu- trients. These are the raw materials, or ingredi- ents, required by the body for optimal health and function."}

{"id": "1453", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "FUNDAMENTALS OF NUTRITION 247 Each of these nutrient classes has specialised roles within the body that are essential for health and op- timal performance. An inadequate intake of any of these will result in disease, or impaired physical and cognitive functioning, which can normally only be prevented by the nutrient. Of these nutrients, car- bohydrates, fats and proteins provide energy. Water, vitamins and minerals provide no energy but play a vital role in the regulation of body processes. Alco- hol is considered by some to be the seventh nutrient as it also provides a source of energy, but it is not essential. The correct nutrient balance will help athletes re- main healthy and perform optimally. Too much or too little of any one nutrient will affect both health and performance. Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are the single most important source of energy for athletes. They provide approximately four kcal per gram and are the primary fuel source for high intensity exercise (above 60% VO2max) (Coggan and Coyle 1988; Carter et al.2003)."}
{"id": "1454", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Carbohydrates can be classiﬁed as simple and complex. Simple carbohydrates are found in sugary foods such as fruit, fruit juices, sugar and honey and gen- erally provide a quick but short-lasting source of energy. These can be further divided into: monosac- charides, which are simple, one-unit sugars such as glucose, fructose and galactose; and disaccharides, which are formed from two monosaccharides. For example sucrose – or common table sugar – is a combination of glucose and fructose. Complex carbohydrates are found in starchy foods such as pasta, rice, potatoes, bread, vegetables, ce- reals, beans and pulses and provide a stable supply of longer-term energy. Complex carbohydrates can be further divided into: polysaccharides (contain- ing more than two monosaccharides), which include starch (from plant sources) and glycogen (from ani- mals), and dietary ﬁbre (non-starch polysaccharide), which is found in plant foods, cereal, fruit and veg- etables and is crucial to optimal health. Foods, and in particular carbohydrates, can also be classiﬁed by their glycaemic index. The glycaemic index (GI) is a measure of the extent to which a cer- tain food raises blood glucose (Jenkins et al.1981). High GI foods, such as white bread, potatoes, corn- ﬂakes and jelly beans, cause a sharp rise in blood glucose, which is often short lasting and followed by a rebound drop in blood glucose."}
{"id": "1455", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Low GI foods, such as porridge, high-ﬁbre cereal, beans, peanuts and apricots, which are high in ﬁbre and/or protein, give a slower, but more sustained release of glucose causing a slower rise in blood glucose and no re- bound drop. For the healthy population, carbohydrates should contribute approximately 50–60% of the energy intake in the diet, with low GI, high-ﬁbre com- plex carbohydrates providing the majority of this requirement (Salmeron et al.1997; Foster-Powell et al.2002). This should increase to approximately 60–70% in an athletic population. Protein Protein plays a vital role in the maintenance of all body tissues. It is used as the structural basis of all cells, forms the contractile components of muscle, and is used to synthesise haemoglobin, enzymes, hormones, neurotransmitters and antibodies, help- ing to maintain the immune system and regulate all essential chemical reactions. Protein, which contains approximately 4 kcal/gram, is also used as an energy source, supplying about 5–10% of energy expendi- ture (Dohn 1986; Brooks and Mercies 1994). Proteins are made up of amino acids, and it is these amino acids that are the real building blocks of the body. There are 20 amino acids, 12 of which can be synthesised from other amino acids and are considered non-essential and, and eight (nine for children) that are considered essential as they cannot be made within the body and therefore must come from the diet."}
{"id": "1456", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Protein is found in a variety of foods, however not all foods contain all of the essential amino acids. Those that do contain all the essential amino acids are termed complete proteins, which can be found in animal products such as meat, ﬁsh, poultry, eggs, milk and yogurt, as well as soya. Incomplete pro- teins have one or more of the essential amino acids missing. These are usually found in plant foods such as beans, pulses, vegetables, grains and rice. In order to get all of the essential amino acids athletes should either aim to eat complete proteins, such as those gained from animal sources, or combine other pro- teins to ensure that their essential amino acid needs are met."}

Fat Fat has many essential functions within the body that include: energy provision, formation of cell mem- branes and nerve ﬁbres, protection of vital organs, production of hormones, storage and transport of fat soluble vitamins, insulation, suppression of hunger and adding palatability to foods. The body can store large amounts of energy as fat, mostly in the form of subcutaneous adipose tissue, which can be mobilised and transported to the work- ing muscles as a fuel source during exercise, but also as intramuscular fat where it is more readily utilised within the muscles. Fat contains approximately 9kcal/gram making it a very efﬁcient way for the body to store large amounts of energy. High fat foods are therefore con- sidered energy dense, making it easy for athletes to inadvertently consume too much energy from these foods. Managing fat intake is therefore a primary concern for athletes to prevent any unwanted in- crease in body fat. Athletes should also consider the type of fat in the diet. Naturally occurring dietary fat can be either unsaturated or saturated. Unsaturated fatty acids contain one (monounsaturated) or more (polyunsaturated) double bonds between carbon atoms where each double bond replaces two hydrogen atoms. Saturated fatty acids contain no double bonds."}
{"id": "1458", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Unsaturated fatty acids are generally liquid at room temperature and are found in plant sources and ﬁsh. Saturated fats tend to be solid at room temperature and come from animal sources. Saturated fats are associated with increased levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL cholesterol) (Mustad et al.1997) and an increased risk of coronary heart disease, whereas unsaturated fats are associated with a lower risk by reducing serum LDL (Kratz et al.2002) and increasing high-density lipoproteins (HDL cholesterol) (Karmally and Goldber 2006). Trans-fatty acids are formed by a process called hydrogenation. Vegetable oils are chemically changed to give them a higher melting point, effec- tively making them more solid at room temperature, and are used in the manufacture of margarine and other spreads. When unsaturated fatty acids are al- tered, and acquire some of the properties of saturated fatty acids through hydrogenation, they are termed trans-fatty acids. All fats contain a mixture of fatty acid types, but it is the proportion of different fatty acids that makes some fats healthier than others. Fats associated with raised cholesterol levels and heart disease include those high in saturated animal fats (red meat, but- ter, cream, lard), and trans-fatty acids from hydro- genated vegetable oils (baked goods and some mar- garines) (Miettinen et al."}
{"id": "1459", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "1972; Baer et al.2004). Fats with a greater protective effect include monounsatu- rated and polyunsaturated fats found in olive oil and oily ﬁsh (Bucher 2002). While most fatty acids can be synthesised within the body, there are two that are essential. The essential fatty acids are linolenic (omega-3) and linoleic (omega-6) fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids, in particular, are associated with beneﬁcial effects on the cardio-vascular system (Simopoulos 1999). Linolenic fatty acids are found in oily ﬁsh and a range of vegetable oils such as sunﬂower and sesame. Linoleic fatty acids are found in most plant oils, es- pecially corn and soybean oil. Current guidelines for fat intake in a healthy diet recommend no more than 30% of energy intake as total fat, and less than 10% as saturated fat (DoH 1991, 1994). Athletes should aim to avoid or reduce their in- take of the following high fat foods: cake, biscuits, chocolate, fat on meat, sausages, pasties, pies, beef burgers, cheese, butter and cream."}

Vitamins Vitamins are essential organic molecules that cannot be synthesised in the body. Although they are only re- quired in very small quantities, a deﬁciency can lead to symptoms of disease. Vitamins have a range of speciﬁc functions that are essential for health. These include: absorption of nutrients, anti-oxidants and protection of cell membranes, energy metabolism, catalysts for and regulation of chemical reactions and collagen synthesis.

Minerals Minerals have several major roles including the for- mation of bones and teeth, formation of haemoglobin and hormones, muscular contractility, neural con- ductivity, regulation of acid-base balance, and metabolism. Some minerals occur in the body in relatively large amounts. These are known as the major minerals and include: calcium, phosphorus, sulphur, potassium, chlorine, sodium, magnesium, zinc and iron. Other minerals occur in minute quan- tities. These are called trace minerals and include: chromium, cobalt, copper, ﬂuorine, iodine, man- ganese, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, silicon, tin and vanadium (see Table 14.2). Deﬁciencies of any mineral can lead to signs and symptoms of disease. Moderate excesses of sodium, potassium, calcium and chlorine are normally ex- creted by the kidneys, whereas excess intakes of other minerals can be harmful or impair absorption of other micronutrients (e.g. excess calcium inhibits absorption of iron and zinc; excess zinc inhibits ab- sorption of copper) (Fairweather-Tait and Hurrell 1996). In general, a balanced diet that contains a variety of foodstuffs and includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables should provide sufﬁcient quantities of the minerals required for optimal health."}
{"id": "1465", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "FUNDAMENTALS OF NUTRITION 251 Two of the most important minerals for athletes are iron and calcium. Iron is an essential element, which is required for oxygen transport (haemoglobin and myoglobin) and electron transport. It is found in the diet in two forms, haem iron and non-haem iron. Haem iron is generally found in animal foods and has greater bioavailability (10–35%). Non-haem iron, generally found in plant foods, has low bioavailability (2–10%) (Zijp et al.2000). Low iron levels can be due to inadequate diet, malabsorption or increased iron losses. To ensure an adequate iron intake, athletes should eat a va- riety of foods including red meat and green leafy vegetables. Iron absorption can be enhanced by the presence of vitamin C. Excessive intakes of iron are associated with gastrointestinal disorders including constipation, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, whilst chronic excess may lead to high body iron stores and increased risk of cardiovascular disease or can- cer (FSA 2003). The FSA Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals (2003) suggest that, for most people, an intake of approximately 17 mg/day would not be expected to produce adverse effects."}

It forms an integral part of bone structure, muscle contraction, blood clot- ting and transmission of nerve impulses. A deﬁ- ciency can lead to rickets, reduced bone mineral density and osteoporosis, and problems with blood clotting. The best dietary sources of calcium are milk and milk products, and green leafy vegetables. Overall absorption is generally poor and requires adequate vitamin D (FSA 2003). Summary of micronutrients Overall, a diet that is balanced and varied should meet the needs for vitamins and minerals for a healthy population. In athletes, the question of whether vitamins and minerals are required in greater amounts is more complex, and likely to be affected by the interaction between the total volume and intensity of sporting activity and the speciﬁc en- ergy and nutrient intakes of each individual (Volpe 2006). It does appear, however, that a deﬁciency will have a negative impact on performance (Volpe 2006). Water Water is by far the most important nutrient. It ac- counts for 50–75% of body weight, depending on body fat content, with fat tissue containing approx- imately 20% water, lean tissue approximately 75%, and blood around 95%."}
{"id": "1467", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Water has many crucial roles including temperature control (sweating), lubrica- tion (brain, eyes, spinal cord and digestive system), a solvent for all biochemical reactions, and the trans- portation of nutrients and oxygen to, and carbon dioxide and other metabolic waste products away from, the working muscles. For optimal cardiovas- cular and thermoregulatory function athletes must therefore maintain sufﬁcient body ﬂuid levels and avoid dehydration, which results in a decrease in both cardiovascular (Gonzalez-Alonso et al.1997) and strength and power performance (Jones et al.2008). Water is gained from drink, food and metabolic re- actions and is lost through urine, faeces, expired air and sweat. Alcohol Alcohol is a non-essential nutrient that has a range of negative effects for athletes. It causes intoxication, affects skill and co-ordination, leads to dehydration, de-motivates, inhibits recovery, lowers testosterone and provides an energy source (7kcal/gram) that can only be utilised once it has been deposited as fat. Overall, alcohol is highly detrimental to sporting performance, signiﬁcantly reducing aerobic perfor- mance capacity for several hours after consumption (O’Brien and Lyons 2000; El-Sayed et al.2005).

RNIs, however, do not take into account the individual needs of athletes determined by the individual, the sport and the level of training. For athletes, a diet that is adequate for health may not be optimal for performance, due primarily to an increased energy expenditure. The current UK government guidelines for health suggest a balance of approximately 55% carbohy- drate, 15% protein and less than 30% fat (of which saturated fat should account for less than 10%) (FSA 2008). Again, these recommendations act as a good starting point for athletes but, as discussed later, there are a number of circumstances where these recom- mendations are modiﬁed. The optimal diet for an athlete will depend on the sport, activity levels, body size, weight gain or weight loss, and the type of training performed at any given time. The food guide pyramid (Figure 14.2) is a com- mon tool to help individuals achieve a healthy bal- ance of foods within the diet. The pyramid shows the proportion and type of foods, which contribute to a healthy, balanced diet. At the base of the pyramid are carbohydrate-based foods, and requirements for fruit and vegetables."}

In fact, Lundy et al. (2006) recommended that these athletes increase their energy intake through additional car- bohydrate consumption. Calculating energy needs Energy needs can be calculated by the following formula: Energy EAR (eatimated average requirement) = BMR (basal metabolic rate) × PAL (Physical Activity Level). PAL refers to the ratio of total energy required over 24 hours to the BMR over 24 hours. For example a PAL of 1.4 represents very low activity levels, 1.6 represents moderate activity levels, and 1.9 represents high activity levels. Most athletes will have a PAL of 1.9 or above.

Carbohydrate requirements for performance The selection of fuel for muscular work is directly related to the intensity of effort with the higher the intensity, the greater the reliance on carbohydrate as a substrate (see Figure 14.3) (Romjin et al.1993). As most sports are performed at high intensities car- bohydrate becomes the primary source of energy. In the body, carbohydrate is stored primarily as muscle and liver glycogen. Carbohydrate stores, however, are limited to approximately 450g of muscle glycogen (with a range from 50g after exhaustive exercise to approximately 900g in a large, well-trained, well-rested, and well-fed athlete (Jeukendrup 2003, de Jonge and Smith 2008), 100–120g of liver glycogen, and 5g of circulating blood glucose.

Pre-exercise To delay fatigue, and therefore enhance perfor- mance, athletes should optimise muscle glycogen stores pre-exercise (Astrand and Rodahl 1986). In short, glycogen stores must be sufﬁcient to allow completion of the event at the highest possible in- tensity. It is important to distinguish between max- imal and optimal storage of glycogen. For events where glycogen depletion becomes a limiting factor for performance (e.g. the marathon, a soccer match) it is clearly desirable to maximise stores prior to the race or game. For shorter events, for example, a 10K race, maximising glycogen stores may not be desirable."}

Athletes should therefore only seek to ‘carbo-load’ for sports where glycogen depletion may become a limiting factor in perfor- mance. Carbohydrate-loading Athletes can maximise muscle glycogen stores through a carbohydrate loading regime (see Table 14.3). There are several protocols for doing this. Early research suggested athletes should perform an exhaustive bout or bouts of exercise followed by 3-4 days of very low carbohydrate intake or very low carbohydrate/high fat intake, followed ﬁnally by 3-4 days of extremely high carbohydrate intake (Ahlborg et al.1967; Bergstrom et al.1967). Although this did increase muscle glycogen stores, athletes were re- luctant to train so hard and felt lethargic and irritable just a few days before competition. A later and more widely adopted protocol involved tapering training over a seven day period and increasing consumption of carbohydrate for three days before the race (Sherman et al.1981)."}

The main advantage of this protocol is not that higher glycogen levels are reached, but that they are achieved in a much shorter time-frame (24 hours) and do not necessarily require an extended period of tapering. Whilst there may be obvious advantages to athletes that compete on a regular basis – for example, team sport athletes – there is, as yet, little evidence to support the use of this method in a practi- cal setting over Sherman et al. (1981), particularly as the potential negative effects of the 3-minute intense bout 24-hours before competition are not yet fully realised. Liver glycogen stores in particular are sensitive to dietary intake of carbohydrate and can be depleted by the overnight fast. To replenish liver glycogen stores, athletes should eat breakfast and/or consume a pre-competition meal.

During exercise Whilst the beneﬁts of pre-competition (or pre- training) carbohydrate loading are well established, there is also clear evidence for an ergogenic effect of carbohydrate feeding during an event (Coggan and Coyle 1991). Rather than reducing the rate of glyco- gen utilisation (Bergstrom et al.1967; Tsintzas et al.1996), carbohydrate ingestion appears to maintain blood glucose levels late in exercise, thus maintaining carbohydrate oxidation, and therefore performance, during endurance exercise (Coyle et al.,1986, Coggan and Coyle, 1991).

These are palatable, convenient to take, and generally tolerated well by athletes. Sports drinks typically contain around 60g of carbohydrate per litre, which is close to the maximum amount of exogenous carbohydrate that the body can ab- sorb and oxidise per hour (1-1.1g/min) (Jeukendrup and Jentjens 2000; Wallis et al.2007; Jeukendrup, 2008). For longer events, athletes can carry small snacks of easily digested high-carbohydrate foods (e.g. sports gels, jelly-beans, jam sandwiches). To identify what they like and what they can tolerate, athletes should practice eating and drinking during training. Depending on the priority (ﬂuid delivery or carbohydrate delivery) athletes can vary the con- centration of carbohydrate in the sports drink. For example, a 5% solution will be more appropriate for those athletes wishing to replenish both water and carbohydrate. A 10% solution will be more suited to carbohydrate delivery at the expense of gastric emptying (Maughan 1991) however, during exercise this may result in gastrointestinal distress in some individuals. It is often difﬁcult for team sport athletes to con- sume food or ﬂuid during the game."}

Post-exercise To enhance recovery and provide the fuel for the next match or training session, athletes must restore their muscle glycogen stores as soon as possible post- exercise. If glycogen stores are low at the start of the next training session, muscle glycogen and overall carbohydrate utilisation will be reduced, lowering the exercise intensity that can be maintained. The rate and extent of glycogen re-synthesis is dependent on the quantity, timing and type of car- bohydrate ingestion, and on the nature of recovery (Maughan et al.1997). How much?Glycogen re-synthesis depends on the quantity of di- etary carbohydrate consumed. To replenish glycogen stores athletes should consume at least 1g/kg.bw im- mediately post-exercise (Ivy 1998) or a minimum of 1–1.85g/kg.bw of carbohydrate per hour in the ﬁrst few hours post-exercise (Jentjens and Jeukendrup 2003) and maintain a daily intake of 5–7g/kg.bw/day during periods of moderate training (1–2 hours per day), 7–10g/kg.bw/day when training load is in- creased (2–3 hours per day), and 10–13g per kg/day during periods of hard or prolonged training (over 3 hours per day) (Jeukendrup and Gleeson 2004).

When carbohydrate feeding is de- layed, lower rates of muscle glycogen synthesis will occur (Jentjens and Jeukendrup 2003). Therefore, to facilitate glycogen resynthesis, athletes should consume carbohydrates as soon as possible post- exercise. What?High glycaemic index snacks (eg.jaffa cakes, jelly beans, toast and jam) and, in particular, carbohydrate based drinks are convenient, easily and more rapidly absorbed and digested, and will provide sufﬁcient carbohydrate until consumption of a larger meal. In order to maintain the high level of carbohydrate intake and glycogen resynthesis, the post-exercise meal should be based around complex carbohydrates such as pasta, rice or potatoes.

Fat as a fuel for exercise Whilst high-intensity exercise is fuelled predomi- nantly by carbohydrate, at lower intensities, or late in prolonged exercise, fat becomes increasingly important (Klein et al.1994; Horowitz and Klein 2000). In contrast to limited carbohydrate stores, fat stores are large, with an average person storing over 100,000 kcal of energy as fat, mainly as subcutaneous adipose tissue. Due to limits in the fat oxidation process, however, these stores cannot be fully utilised for exercise.

Intensity At rest the majority of our fuel requirements come from fat. As exercise intensity rises, the rate of lipol- ysis and oxidation increase to a maximum at ap- proximately 64% VO2 max (Achten et al.2002). At higher exercise intensities (approximately 86–89% of VO2 max) the contribution of fat oxidation to en- ergy expenditure is negligible (Achten et al.2002; Achten and Jeukendrup 2003), probably due to the restricted transport of fatty acids to the mitochon- dria via limited blood ﬂow to subcutaneous tissue, and lactate accumulation (Coyle et al.1997). Duration As exercise progresses, fat oxidation plays an in- creasingly important role. As liver and muscle glyco- gen stores decrease, the body’s ability to oxidise car- bohydrate is depleted and fat becomes the dominant fuel, with an associated drop in exercise intensity (not ideal during competition). Carbohydrate intake Carbohydrate consumption also appears to decrease fat oxidation (Horowitz et al."}
{"id": "1489", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "1997). Therefore a pre-exercise meal that is high in carbohydrate will reduce fat oxidation. Despite this suppression of fat oxidation, the overall aim is to increase carbohydrate oxidation and therefore pre-exercise carbohydrate intake should be paramount. Increasing fat oxidation To enhance the use of fat as an energy source, and therefore save glycogen stores, athletes can adopt several practices. Endurance training is the most effective, increasing the rate of lipid metabolism through increased size and number of muscle mi- tochondria, increased activity of lipid oxidising en- zymes, and increased intra-muscular triacylglycerol stores (Coyle 1995; Phillips et al.1996). Evidence for dietary manipulation of fat intake to enhance fat oxidation, however, is inconclusive with high-fat di- ets and supplementation with medium-chain triglyc- erides failing to show any signiﬁcant ergogenic ben- eﬁt (Hawley et al.1998; Hawley 2002). Whilst caf- feine ingestion has been shown to increase endurance performance, usually attributed to an increased level of lipid oxidation (Ivy et al.1979) it is still unclear whether this is due to enhanced fat metabolism (Gra- ham 2001)."}

At higher intensities fat ox- idation is restricted.r Carbohydrate feeding reduces lipolysis and fatty acid availability, which inhibits fat oxidation and increases carbohydrate usage.r Manipulation of fat in the diet via high fat diets, or medium chain triglycerides has a limited beneﬁt for performance. Protein requirements for performance Do athletes need more protein than non-athletes?Whilst the current UK RNI for protein is 0.75g/kg.body-weight per day (FSA 2008), there are several mechanisms by which athletes could require more.

As competition approaches, a drink of 500–600ml 2–3 hours before exercise followed by another 200–300 ml 10–20 minutes before exercise begins (Casa et al.2000) will en- sure athletes arrive in a well-hydrated state. Tak- ing regular sips until, the start may be a use- ful way for athletes to consume these quantities. For longer events, where dehydration may inhibit performance, athletes should drink an additional 400–600ml of water (or carbohydrate solution) immediately before exercise. Athletes should ex- periment in training to ensure they can tolerate both the quantity and the type of drink. During exercise: drink 100–300ml of water every 15 minutes as tolerated (Rehrer et al.1990). For team sports, drink at halftime or during breaks in play. Again, athletes should practice drinking during training."}

After exercise: the priority post-exercise is to replen- ish what was lost (both in terms of ﬂuid and glyco- gen stores). Fluid intake needs to be about 150% of weight lost during exercise to achieve normal hydration within 6 hours post-exercise (Shirreffs et al.1996). Ingesting plain water though is largely ineffective as this dilutes plasma and inhibits the secretion of anti-diuretic hormone. Adding sodium (60–80 mmol/litre) will reduce urinary water loss, aiding ﬂuid retention and the recovery of ﬂuid balance (Nose et al.1988; Sharp 2006). Moreover, adding sodium will trigger thirst and promote drinking. Cool ﬂuids are more palatable. Therefore to promote rapid recovery of ﬂuid balance post exercise, athletes should focus on both volume of ﬂuid (around 150% of weight loss) and sodium content (60–80mmol/litre)."}

Hydration for team sports Team sports such as football, rugby, hockey and net- ball present another problem. Often athletes can- not consume ﬂuid throughout the match or training session. Athletes therefore need to ensure adequate hydration on days prior to a match, follow the pre- exercise ﬂuid intake guidelines above, aim to con- sume at least 500ml at half time, and try to drink during any other breaks in play such as during in- jury breaks. Post-match, athletes should follow the guidelines above for rehydration post-exercise. Carbohydrate versus fluid delivery Carbohydrates provide the substrate for glycogen resynthesis and maintenance of blood glucose, but there can be a conﬂict with ﬂuid absorption at higher carbohydrate concentrations. If an athlete is dehy- drated then ﬂuid (and electrolyte) intake will be paramount. A carbohydrate concentration of no more than 4–6% will ensure that gastric emptying is not affected. If carbohydrate is the priority (either for ox- idation or glycogen resynthesis) then higher levels up to about 10% may be consumed. Summary/Key points r Start well hydrated."}

During exercise it is likely that micronutient requirements will increase (Whit- ing and Barabash 2006). Micronutrient intake varies widely between indi- viduals and groups, with dietary surveys of athletes showing both high and low reported intakes of some vitamins and minerals, leading to the possibility of a long-term deﬁcient diet or health problems asso- ciated with excess intakes. Athlete groups that may be at risk of insufﬁcient micronutrient intake include those on restricted energy intakes (Haymes 1991), vegetarians, female athletes, those involved in en- durance or aesthetic sports, and athletes in weight category sports. In these groups, consumption of a multi-vitamin supplement may ensure adequate intakes and avoid deﬁciency (Beals and Manore 1998). There is no clear evidence that elevated intakes of vitamins or minerals will increase performance and no evidence that athletes require signiﬁcantly higher levels of micronutrients than non-athletes. The pri- ority therefore should be to avoid deﬁciency through the consumption of a diet that is both sufﬁcient and balanced. There are, however, several key micronutrients that either play a pivotal role during exercise or are particularly prone to deﬁciency. Vitamin B Because vitamin B plays an essential role in the re- lease of energy from carbohydrates, fat and protein, and in the formation of haemoglobin, a deﬁciency can have serious consequences for the athlete, lead- ing to fatigue and decreases in VO2 max and power (van der Beek et al.1994)."}
{"id": "1509", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Athletes at risk of pos- sible deﬁciency may be those with restricted diets or vegans, whereas athletes with an energy rich diet are unlikely to be deﬁcient. Good sources of the B vitamins include meat, ﬁsh, milk, eggs, wholegrain cereals, fortiﬁed breakfast cereals and some vegeta- bles. Although, with a balanced and energy rich diet supplementation is generally unnecessary, a multi- vitamin will help meet requirements for athletes who may be unsure of their status. Vitamin C and antioxidants Although there is no evidence that athletes need more vitamin C than non-athletes, it is possible that an- tioxidant supplementation may decrease exercise- induced oxidative stress (Ji 1999; Morillas-Ruiz et al.2006). Overall, athletes should avoid deﬁciency and obtain antioxidants via increased consumption of fruit and vegetables. Large doses of single antiox- idant compounds are not recommended. Minerals and exercise Exercise is associated with increased losses of min- erals in sweat and urine. Iron, calcium, magnesium and zinc may be a cause for concern in some ath- lete groups due to insufﬁcient intakes and increased losses in sweat and urine. Of these, calcium and iron have the biggest impact on health and performance."}
{"id": "1510", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Iron Iron depletion (low iron stores: low serum ferritin) is common in athletes (26% women, 11% men- Malczewska et al.2001) but does not necessarily af- fect performance (Risser et al.1988). Iron deﬁciency without anaemia may, however, impair adaptation to endurance training (Brownlie et al.2004) in previ- ously untrained women, but can be corrected with iron supplementation. Iron deﬁciency with anaemia (low haemoglobin) can impair work capacity and decrease exercise performance (Haas and Brownlie 2001). Athletes at risk of iron deﬁciency include young athletes, female athletes (Beard and Tobin 2000; Gropper et al.2006), athletes on low energy intakes (less than 300kcal/day), athletes in weight category sports, endurance athletes (Spodaryk 1993), vege- tarians, and athletes training in hot climates or at altitude. There are a number of ways to increase iron: 1. Athletes should eat foods rich in haem-iron at least four times per week (e.g. liver, lean red meat) as iron from these foods is readily absorbed."}

Athletes can increase the absorption of iron from non-haem iron foods by consuming them with vi- tamin C-rich foods (e.g. orange juice) and avoid- ing tea at meals. Calcium Athletes with low energy intakes and who avoid dairy products may not meet their calcium require- ments. This is a particular problem for female athletes on low energy intakes (Clarkson 1995) as amenorrhea may further hinder bone development and increase the risk of osteoporosis. The current UK recommended daily intake of calcium is 700mg, with an upper safe limit of 2500mg. Calcium cannot be absorbed without Vitamin D (FSA 2008). There are a number of ways to increase calcium: 1. Athletes should include three servings per day of low-fat dairy foods. Include these in high carbo- hydrate meals (e.g. skimmed milk on cereal).2."}

Supplementing calcium to 125% RNI helps main- tain bone density when amenorrhea is present. Summary Maintaining adequate intakes of vitamins and miner- als is essential for health and performance. This can be achieved through a varied and balanced diet. Ath- letes who consume sufﬁcient energy from a balanced diet are unlikely to have vitamin and mineral deﬁ- ciencies (Armstrong and Maresh, 1996), however, the use of a multi-vitamin and mineral supplement for groups at risk or on low energy intakes may be appropriate."}
{"id": "1514", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Nutrition for injury prevention Delaying fatigue The most important nutritional consideration for in- jury prevention is in delaying the onset of fatigue. If an athlete is fatigued, there is a change in running mechanics (Gerlach et al.2005; Kellis and Liassou 2009), landing mechanics (King et al.2005), a de- creased ability to maintain joint alignment, control and appropriate muscular activation patterns during potentially risky manoeuvres (Wojtys et al.1996; Chappell et al.2005), an increased incidence of high- risk actions (Rahnama et al.2002), and an actual increase in injury occurrence towards the end of a match or phase of play (Hawkins et al.2001). To limit fatigue, athletes should consume a diet that allows them to maintain optimal performance throughout the duration of a race, match or training session. The two most important nutrients to prevent fatigue are carbohydrate and water."}
{"id": "1515", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Carbohydrate One of the primary factors linking fatigue and injury is the level of muscle glycogen (Sherman and Costill 1984; Costill and Hargreaves 1992). If muscle glyco- gen is low, athletes will not be able to maintain exer- cise intensity, muscles will fatigue and lose strength along with the ability to protect joints, coordination will suffer, protective motor programmes will be re- placed by less efﬁcient and more risky movement patterns, awareness of the game and environment will decrease, and reactions will slow (Schlabach 1994). These are the circumstances when injury is most likely to occur. Therefore the primary nutrient that is required to avoid fatigue is carbohydrate. Athletes who are maintaining high-volume high-intensity exercise are most at risk and must optimise carbohydrate intake. Athletes should aim to consume 5–13g/kg.bw per day (depending on volume and intensity of exercise) by eating pre, during and post exercise (Jeukendrup and Gleeson 2004). Long-term fatigue Athletes that are in heavy training for prolonged pe- riods are at risk of progressively depleting glycogen stores leading to a drop off in performance, increased risk of injury, compromised immune system and in- creased risk of illness, and ultimately overtraining syndrome (Kirwan et al.1988). Fluid Fluid intake is the other primary factor in reduc- ing signs of fatigue. The effects of dehydration"}

There is also a greater risk of heat injury when dehydrated, as the body is un- able to thermo-regulate effectively. Glycogen use in- creases when dehydrated, further compounding the problems. Athletes should be aware of and look out for the effects of dehydration. Initially these may include thirst, dark urine, tiredness, lack of concentration, dry skin and headache. Fluid intake should be moni- tored and matched to sweat losses. Fluid replacement strategies should be in place before, during, and af- ter the game or training (Rehrer et al.1990; Shirreffs et al.1996; Casa et al.2000; Sharp 2006)."}
{"id": "1517", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Other factors to consider in injury prevention Iron Low iron intakes have the potential to affect injury risk through fatigue. In a study on female cross- country runners, over the course of the season, there were 71 injuries that caused a loss of training time. The 34 runners with the lowest ferritin concentra- tions had twice as many injuries as the 34 runners with the highest ferritin (Loosli et al.1993). As iron plays a crucial role in the transport of oxygen to mus- cles, it is likely that athletes with low haemoglobin (caused by iron deﬁciency) have decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, reducing work capacity (Viteri and Torun 1974), and therefore fatigue more easily. Bone health Nutrition can affect bone health in several ways. First, low fat and low energy intakes are associated with an increased risk of stress fractures particu- larly in physically active women (Frusztajer et al.1990; Nattiv 2000). Supplementation with calcium (2000mg) and Vitamin D (800IU), however, has been shown to decrease the incidence of stress fractures in female navy recruits by 20% compared with a placebo (Lappe et al.2008)."}
{"id": "1518", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "In the longer term, a diet that is deﬁcient in energy, fat, calcium or vitamin D may lead to osteoporosis. Moreover other nutrients, such as magnesium and potassium, along with an adequate protein intake, also appear to play a signiﬁcant role in preventing the loss of bone mineral density (Hannan et al.2000; Tucker et al.2001). Athletes, and in particular female athletes, should therefore ensure they consume a balanced diet con- taining sufﬁcient energy, protein, fat, calcium and vitamin D with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables to ensure a balanced micronutrient intake (Tucker et al.2001). Nutrition during injury Injury can lead to a range of complex nutritional issues for some athletes. Body mass management (preventing weight gain during injury, restoration of muscle mass post injury) is crucial for effective rehabilitation. For example, if the athlete has a sig- niﬁcant reduction in activity levels as a result of injury, then the diet will need to change to reﬂect the drop in energy expenditure. Moreover, athletes with poor diets, who have previously avoided weight gain through training, or those who turn to food for comfort, are likely to put on weight when injured, making it harder for them to return to full ﬁtness."}
{"id": "1519", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "If, however, the athlete can maintain energy expendi- ture through other forms of exercise, then diet may not need to change. Education is a priority. Athletes must aim for a nutrient rich and healthy diet that is sufﬁcient to maintain energy balance. Athletes should focus on low-fat, low-sugar, high-ﬁbre foods that provide suf- ﬁcient carbohydrate, protein and fat, and which pro- vide optimal vitamin and mineral intakes. Despite lower activity levels when injured, ath- letes who are hospitalised, or subject to long-term incapacity, may still require increased protein (ap- prox 1.4–1.7g/kg/day) to prevent loss of lean tissue, and maintain immune function (Bucci 1994). This can be met through the selection of low-fat pro- tein options such as lean meat, ﬁsh and skimmed milk. Supplements The use of supplements by athletes requires caution. Whilst there is a substantial body of evidence that some substances found in the diet have an ergogenic or anabolic effect under certain conditions – for example, caffeine for endurance and power per- formance, and creatine for increasing short-term high-intensity exercise and muscle mass (Birch et al.1994; Williams and Branch 1998; Greenhaff 2000; Graham 2001; Maughan et al.2004; Doherty and Smith 2005; Hespel et al."}

Moreover, many supplements contain substances not declared on the label and in some cases these substances contravene IOC or WADA doping regulations and would cause an athlete to fail a drugs test (Geyer et al.2004; Maughan 2005). For example, in an IOC funded study of 634 products labelled as non-hormonal nutritional supplements from 13 countries and 215 different suppliers, 14.8% contained anabolic steroid precursors not declared on the label (Schanzer 2002; Geyer et al.2004). For products purchased in the UK this ﬁgure rose to 18.8% (Schanzer 2002; Geyer et al.2004). It appears that, for those athletes who may be re- quired to take a drugs test, supplements are another potential source of contamination. It is therefore pos- sible that an athlete could fail a drugs test due to the unintentional ingestion of prohibited substances present in dietary supplements (Maughan 2005). It is simply impossible to know for sure that any given supplement is pure and not contaminated by some substance that may be prohibited."}

The unin- tentional ingestion of prohibited substances is not considered an acceptable excuse and athletes should therefore exhibit extreme caution when deciding on the use of dietary supplements. Moreover, supple- ments should not be considered a solution to a poor diet and athletes should strive to optimise their nu- tritional intake before considering the need for sup- plements. The full position statement of UK Sport (2008) concerning the use of supplements appears below. Position statement of UK Sport, Version 5, issued in July 2008. There is an array of supplements available for athletes to purchase through a range of retail sources that have no prohibited substances listed as ingredients.

UK athletes are advised to be vigilant in their choice to use any supplement. No guarantee can be given that any particular supplement is free from Prohibited Substances.

An important principle of the World Anti-Doping Code (WADC) is that of strict liability stating athletes are ultimately responsible for any Prohibited Substances found in their system or for the use of any Prohibited Method. Therefore before taking supplements athletes must assess the risk and understand their personal responsibility. In an attempt to support athletes a number of initiatives have been created globally to identify whether a prohibited substance can be identiﬁed within a supplement. As such, supplements may claim to be drug free or safe for drug tested athletes. It is not possible to guarantee that speciﬁc supplements will be free of prohibited substances but only to reduce the risk of inadvertent doping by making informed decisions. In the UK HFL Sports Science has taken the initiative to create a scheme to support athletes in assessing the risk. The Informed-Sport programme is designed to evaluate supplement manufacturers for their process integrity and screening of supplements and ingredients for the presence of prohibited substances that are present on the WADC Prohibited List. The supplements industry has been consulted on this approach and supports its development."}

Nordin Dance Science, Trinity Laban Earle Abrahamson London Sport Institute at Middlesex University The aim of this chapter is to illustrate the importance of psychology for a professional working in sports rehabilitation and to provide you with some practi- cal ways of applying psychology in your practice. Psychology has been used with injured athletes in two main ways; ﬁrstly in identifying those at risk of injury, and secondly in enhancing recovery. In addition, helping injured athletes to develop psycho- logical skills, such as goal setting or imagery, will ensure that they are not only ‘physically ﬁt’ follow- ing sports rehabilitation but also ‘mentally ﬁt’ for their subsequent return to sport (Murphy 2005). The chapter is divided into two sections to help you ﬁrst focus on theory and issues before examining the application. Section one begins with a brief ex- amination of why psychology is important to you as a sports rehabilitator. It continues on to the importance of the stress model as a basis of identifying players who may be at a higher risk of injury (Williams and Andersen 1998). The section proceeds with a discussion of emotional responses such as the grief- loss model (K¨ubler-Ross 1969) and its relevance to athletes who are injured. Following on from this is the behavioural issue of adherence. The ﬁrst section continues with a mention of mental toughness as a way to facilitate adherence and concludes with the SCRAPE model (Hinderliter and Cardinal 2007) as a way of organising the variables of injury recovery. The latter half of the chapter discusses psychologi- cal skills training in relation to injury prevention and management."}

However, the reality of the rehabilitative process is that it can be painful, time consuming and uncomfortable. Your patient/client may require techniques for managing pain and relieving stress. Therefore, you will need to address the psycholog- ical and emotional issues of your injured athlete. If your athlete is to heal psychologically as well as physically then you need to understand how issues such as stress and adherence affect the rehabilita- tion process.

{"id": "1562", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "276 PSYCHOLOGY AND SPORTS REHABILITATION of psychology to sports rehabilitation is often ne- glected in the training of sports rehabilitators and other practitioners (Mann et al.2007). Practitioners often report that they wish they had more training in psychology (Francis, Andersen and Maley 2000; Ninedek and Kolt 2000; Sheppard 2004) as better in- tegration of psychology within a rehabilitation pro- gramme will increase a sports rehabilitator’s under- standing on the psychology of injury (Hemming and Povey 2002). Arvinen-Barrow, Hemmings, Weigand and Becker (2007) pointed out that physiotherapists perceived that athletes suffered psychologically for approximately 83% of the time they were injured. According to Arvinen-Barrow and her colleagues (2007), sports injury professionals utilised some psy- chological techniques but felt that additional psycho- logical training would be beneﬁcial. In a recent study, Hamson-Utley, Martin and Walters (2008) found that those working in sports rehabilitation do have positive attitudes on the effectiveness of psychological skills in enhancing recovery. With this positive mind set, you should ﬁnd that this chapter will help you as a sports rehabilitator to integrate psychological theory and practical sug- gestions within sport rehabilitation. It aims to assist you in becoming a more skilled practitioner so that you can help your athletes in a more comprehensive way. To begin, the stress–injury relationship will be examined as this is the foundation in understanding why certain athletes may be more prone to injury. Emotional reponses to sports injury and rehabilitation Understanding athletes’ emotional response to injury has led to a variety of research, which falls into two general categories: cognitive appraisal and the stage model."}
{"id": "1563", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Cognitive appraisal will be explained through Williams and Andersen’s (1998) stress–injury relationship. The stage approach will be examined through K¨ubler-Ross (1969) research on grief and loss. Cognitive appraisal: The stress–injury relationship model There is continued debate regarding stress and de- stressing. Of course, stress can affect performance, but more importantly to you as a sports rehabilitator, stress raises the injury incidence level, making your athlete more prone to injury. Williams and Andersen (2007) showed that approximately 85% of studies conducted since the 1970s have demonstrated a positive correlation between life-event stress and injury. In fact, stressed athletes run a 2–5 times greater risk of injury than athletes with low life- event stress. This is quite an extraordinary ﬁnding and is consistent across numerous sports (Williams and Andersen 2007). Stress as a result of injury is also commonly identiﬁed by practitioners as being present during the rehabilitation process. Heaney (2006) noted that stress and anxiety was present in professional footballers 73% of the time that they were injured. For those working with youth teams and academies, stress is also present in children (Nippert and Smith 2008)."}
{"id": "1564", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Components of the model Let us examine each of the components of the sport stress–injury relationship, illustrated above by Williams and Andersen (1998), so you can see how an understanding of each of the parts as well as the integration of the model, can be useful to you as a sports rehabilitator. Personality Personality is deﬁned as “a dynamic organisation, in- side the person, of psychophysical systems that cre- ate a person’s characteristic patterns of behaviour, thoughts, and feelings” (Carver and Scheier 2000, p.5). The deﬁnition above implies that personality is dynamic. We are born with some aspects of a person- ality (traits) and this innate genetic predisposition may be difﬁcult to change or may be unchangeable. For example, some athletes are naturally more anx- ious and this is known as trait anxiety. Your athletes therefore may have certain traits that are integral to their personality and hard to alter. However, other aspects of personality are more environmental ori- ented and may be changeable. These are referred to as state or situational characteristics. That is, your athlete may react to certain events in a particular way whether or not they possess a particular trait. For instance, they may become more nervous in a competitive situation, or in your clinic, or before returning back to a game following an injury (e.g. state anxiety), even if they are not trait anxious."}

It is important to distinguish between trait and state as some athletes may appear only to have prob- lems at certain times and that may be confusing to you as a rehabilitator. Knowing if this is a usual trait (e.g. your athlete is usually anxious) or whether it is the situation (e.g. a speciﬁc competitive event or part of the event – such as starting on the blocks) is causing the problem is helpful in helping your athlete to change. If it is a usual trait then you can encourage daily coping strategies for dealing with something that is part of their usual personality. If it is a state then you can help to identify the trigger and promote strategies to assist your athlete in coping with a speciﬁc situation. A speciﬁc personality variable that has been re- lated to stress is self-esteem, or how you value your- self. As you might guess, those with lower self- esteem are more likely to feel stressed (Kolt and Roberts 1998). During the sporting season, athletes with low self-esteem and low mood states (e.g. anx- iety and depression) were more susceptible to being stressed (Williams et al.1993), which means that they will be more prone to injury as illustrated by Williams and Andersen (1998). Hence, as a sports rehabilitator, get to know your athlete’s personality and remember that even the most conﬁdent player on the pitch may suffer from anxiety or low conﬁdence or some sort of a change in state personality when injured."}
{"id": "1567", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "History of stressors History of stressors refers to how an athlete feels about previous events and/or experiences. These can be real threats such as recovery from a major injury or a perceived threat such as the worry of recovery from an injury that has returned to complete physical ﬁtness. In addition, history of stressors or previous experience can refer to prior major life events or even the impact of minor occurrences. Research has demonstrated that experiences can impact on the risk of an athlete getting injured again (Maddison and Prapavessis 2005; Steffen et al.2008). For example, an athlete who has had previous injuries may be worried about returning to a compet- itive level of sport. They may be concerned over the severity of previous injury and the potential risk of re-injury and may enter an event apprehensively with elevated levels of stress. The threat of injury may be real or imagined. For example, a study by Chase, Magyar and Drake (2005) found that gymnasts were fearful of injuries especially as they worried about how hard it was to return to competition after suf- fering from an injury. Therefore, these athletes were more worried about what ‘could happen’."}
{"id": "1568", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Working with athletes on self-conﬁdence can be beneﬁcial in helping support athletes dealing with a history of injuries. Major life-changing events or minor hassles, can have an impact on the athlete. Major life events can be sporting related, such as returning to sport with a disability, or more generic for example, a relation- ship breakdown or death of a loved one. This was conﬁrmed by Williams and Andersen (2007) in their review of over 40 studies. Although it is fairly ob- vious to us that major life events can increase stress levels, it is also possible that much smaller hassles or stressors can have a similar effect. For instance, a study by Fawkner, McMurray and Summer (1999) found that signiﬁcant increases in minor events can elevate stress. This could be arriving at the compe- tition where all the events are delayed due to rain or arriving late when the minibus you are travelling in breaks down on the way to an event. In all likelihood, it is not only the stress that creates a problem but also because anything that is on your mind, whether small or large, can act as a distraction from the sporting task at hand. A disruption to your athlete’s ability to concentrate, attentional disruption, can also increase your athlete’s risk of becoming injured. Coping resources Hanson et al. ("}

Therefore a better understanding of coping strategies for you as a sports rehabilitator has the potential to make a signiﬁcant impact on your practice. A more detailed introduction to coping skills is provided in section two (psychological skills). If you look at the stress model again you can see how coping strategies feed into the stress response as well as interact with personality. Coping strate- gies are ways of dealing with problems or situations. Folkman and Lazarus (1984, p141) deﬁne it as “con- stantly changing cognitive and behavioural efforts to manage speciﬁc external and /or internal demands"}

It has been found that a variety of coping strategies are utilised in sport (Nicholls et al.2007), such as venting, crying, or even the use of alcohol and drugs (Kowalski and Crocker 2001). There are two types or categories of coping strategies predominantly used: problem-focused and emotion-focused coping (Lazarus and Folkman 1984). Emotion-focused coping is dealing with and managing emotions. Problem-focused coping is fo- cusing on or managing the problem. Within these categories there are a variety of coping strate- gies (Wethington and Kessler 1991)."}
{"id": "1571", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "These include avoidance coping such as dealing with the problem by running away, using alcohol or drugs to cope (Carver et al.1989). Some athletes turn to religion as a means of support or enlisting help from other people as in social support. So which strategy is the most productive for our athletes in coping with injury?Research consistently supports the use of various coping strategies for meeting with the demands of injury and life and the necessity for adapting these to meet individual needs. For example, Carson and Polman (2008) cited the beneﬁts of using problem focusing in a case study with a rugby player un- dergoing ACL rehabilitation, while Gallagher and Gardner (2007) advised that avoidance as a coping technique was detrimental to athletes and is asso- ciated with higher levels of negative moods. Social support, on the other hand, is beneﬁcial. Athletes with high levels of social support had fewer injuries regardless of life-event stress, whilst athletes low in social support were prone to more injuries (Hardy et al.1991; Smith et al.1990a)."}

Therefore, recommend that your injured ath- letes seek support from friends (inside and outside sport) and family when they are injured – or, ideally, before. In conclusion, because there is a strong link be- tween having inadequate coping skills and sports injury (Williams et al.1986), it is important for you as a sports rehabilitator to understand what coping strategies are and how effective strategies may be encouraged. The next component within the stress–injury model (Figure 15.1) is cognitive appraisal (how an athlete perceives stress) and physiological/ attentional changes. These will now be discussed. Cognitive appraisal According to the stress model, the way your ath- lete cognitively interprets a situation is affected by their personality and their coping styles. Cognitive appraisal affects stress levels, which can lead to an in- creased risk of injury. The word cognition pertains to thought patterns and processes. Cognitive appraisal is, therefore, what your athlete thinks about a situ- ation which affects their emotional and behavioural responses."}

Interventions Johnson, Ekengren and Andersen (2005), in a study based on the Williams and Andersen (1998) stress–injury model, were able to design a pro- gramme for soccer players who they identiﬁed as being at risk of injury. An at-risk psychosocial pro- ﬁle was created for each athlete through the use of The Sport Anxiety Scale (Smith et al.1990b), the Life Event Scale for Collegiate Athletes (Petrie 1992), and the Athletic Coping Skills Inventory-28 (Smith et al.1995). They implemented an interven- tion scheme which taught athletes skills such as stress management and conﬁdence building. Their study showed that these athletes were injured far less than athletes in a control group. Maddison and Prapavessis (2005) conducted a similar study with rugby players, and found that athletes in the inter- vention group (who were taught to manage stress) had fewer injuries than athletes in the control group. Such studies powerfully demonstrate how psycho- logical interventions can be used to impact the in- jury process – something often thought of as purely physical!Conclusion of the stress model All the components of the stress model have been described and it should now be clear how an integra- tion of these various components works."}
{"id": "1575", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "An athlete’s personality, their previous experiences and ways of dealing with excessive demands feeds into the way they respond to stress. Their stress response is af- fected by their thoughts, their focus and their bodily reactions. Intervention strategies such as goal set- ting, self-talk, coping strategies and imagery, which will be discussed in the second part of the chapter, can help reduce levels of stress caused by the stress response and reduction of stress levels can reduce the incidence of injury. To strengthen your knowledge on the model and coping strategies, refer to: Williams and Andersen (1998) and Lazarus and Folkman (1984). The next part of the chapter will continue with the emotional response to injury within the stage model (K¨ubler-Ross, 1969). Emotional responses to sports injury and rehabilitation: A stage model Being injured is obviously an emotional experience for your athlete (Heil 1993). Tracey (2003) examined the emotional responses experienced by athletes as a result of injury as well as during rehabilitation and revealed that athletes demonstrate a collection of emotions such as a sense of loss, decreased self- esteem, frustration and anger. In examining athletic injury, a classic ‘stage’ model by K¨ubler-Ross (1969) has been applied to sport and outlines a normal progression of emotions (Figure 15.2). Originally, this model was designed as a framework for understanding the psychologi- cal response during the grieving process. However, it was adapted to parallel the stages of emotional response experienced by injured athletes (Crossman 1991)."}
{"id": "1576", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The initial stage is denial where athletes ﬁnd it hard to believe that they are injured. This is usually immediately post-injury. Second is anger, which can be directed at the injury, oneself, or even you as med- ical staff. The third stage is one of bargaining where athletes negotiate a deal, for example, ‘I will do all my exercises and be a better person if I can fully recover and return to competition’. Next is a state of depression, followed by acceptance. The Stages Denial There are two aspects of denial. Firstly, the shock state immediately following the injury when the player is in a state of disbelief and may even respond Denial Anger Negotiation Depression Acceptance Figure 15.2 Stage model of loss."}

Secondly, it may progress into a denial period where the athlete still ﬁnds it hard to accept their limitations due to injury. You can respond back by going through the reality of the situation though it may take time for the athlete to accept it. Anger Secondly, the athlete may express their anger over the situation. They may enter a blame culture in feeling that others have put them here, thinking or saying things such as “The opponent should not have tripped me up . . .”Or they may suggest it is your fault for not doing a good enough job with a previ- ous injury. The best way to manage anger is to stay calm, and never respond back with anger. Remem- ber to defuse by allowing the athlete a bit of time to express their feelings and then to acknowledge that you understand that they are feeling angry and that this is quite normal. Can they remember a previous time when they felt angry due to an injury, illness or bad situation?How did they get through it then?"}
{"id": "1578", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "What do they feel they could do to get through it this time?Bargaining This third stage involves negotiation. The athlete may promise to attend all sessions in exchange for your hard work as a rehabilitator in helping them to return to full recovery. This can include religion where an athlete will promise to be a better person in return for better health. Depression Depression is a sense of hopelessness and despair, and athletes may express sadness and apathy through statements such as “my sports career is over”. Your athlete may not feel like coming to rehabilitative ses- sions or working hard at the home exercises you have given them. When athletes feel despair you can try to boost their emotions by examining a positive focus. For example, what will you do when you complete your rehabilitation?How will you celebrate your return to sport?Can you remember or visualise a time when you felt really successful or happy in your sport?"}
{"id": "1579", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Acceptance Be encouraging and acceptance will be around the corner. Acceptance is acknowledging that an injury has occurred and that the way forward is by working through the rehabilitative process. Your athlete may demonstrate this by saying “I am going to the gym regularly and working on these exercises at home.”Conclusions on the stage model of grief-loss The K¨ubler–Ross (1969) stage model has been criti- cised for being sequential or outlining a set order for this emotional experience. However, psychologists agree that these stages are more like ﬂuid phases and that not all athletes may go through all these emo- tions in the same order. Some athletes may even not display these emotions at all. So as a professional, just be aware of what emotions your client may be going through. Carson and Polman (2008), in working with ante- rior cruciate ligament patients, identiﬁed set stages of shock, depression, relief, encouragement and con- ﬁdence development. To further your knowledge of the K¨ubler-Ross grief loss model, read the article entitled ‘Psychological responses to injury in com- petitive sport: a critical review’ written by Walker, Thatcher and Lavallee (2007). They conducted a study to help professionals (such as you) who are involved in athletic rehabilitation to understand the impact of psychological factors on injury experi- ence."}

Adherence differs from compliance, which as- sumes that the patient will obediently follow your instruction without question. Adherence is a volun- tary, negotiated agreement between the patient and you. Patient involvement is important and is pos- itively related with adherence (Lind et al.2008). However, not all athletes will follow your rehabilita- tion programme as agreed, and adherence can range from under-adherence to over-adherence. Under- adherence is doing less than what is prescribed. The cost of under-adherence to the patient may be a slower recovery as well as lower conﬁdence about their progress. Sometimes additional factors can interfere with progress and be the cause of under-adherence. For example, athletes may receive more attention from their coaches and team members when they are injured than when they are ﬁt."}

Remember that patients can forget to stick to their programmes once or twice, but forgetting three times is probably no longer an accident. Athletes need to display the same commitment to their rehabilitation as they do to their training, though it is important as sports rehabilitator to remember that today’s patients have to balance other commitments as well such as study, friends and family. Over-adherence, on the other hand, is doing more than one should during recovery. Some athletes will over-adhere to a rehabilitation programme in the hope of recovering quicker. This may be due to not wanting to lose their place in an upcoming competi- tion or a position on a team, perfectionist tendencies, or perhaps pressure from other people such as their coach or teammates. One way of helping athletes to adhere to their recovery programme is to get them to use a diary. An interesting study by Pizzari, Taylor, McBurney and Feller (2005) examined the relationship between adherence and outcome following ACL surgery. Ad- herence was measured by a self-reported diary of home exercise and from attendance to appointments. In clinical practice, the use of a diary to track daily and weekly progress is an easy way of both em- powering the athlete to track their own progress, and perhaps for you to examine adherence – if they let you see their diary, that is!"}

The use of a self-reported diary to track home exercise appears to be a useful way of monitor- ing adherence, you may wish to consider this when working with clients. Factors that influence adherence Through interviews with sports physiotherapists, Niven (2007) identiﬁed a number of factors that inﬂuence adherence in sports rehabilitation pro- grammes. In particular and athlete’s personality as well as situational factors impact adherence to rehabilitation programmes. Personality may impact on adherence as athletes who are high in anxiety show reduced adherence to their rehabilitative programmes (Taylor and Taylor 1997). In addition, how your athlete perceives the efﬁcacy of your treatment protocol and the conﬁdence they have in rehabilitation will affect their adherence to your sports injury programme (Brewer et al.2003; Taylor and May 1996)."}

Determinants of adherence One way of altering adherence is to identify the fac- tors that determine their adherence to a programme. Crossman (2001) divided the factors into three clas- siﬁcations: predisposing, reinforcing and enabling factors.

{"id": "1587", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Although mental tough- ness is a relatively new area of research, studies are demonstrating that these factors are important as part of an athlete’s mindset. Levy, Polman Clough, Marchant and Earle (2006) found that patients with high mental toughness were more capable of managing pain and displaying a more positive outlook. Mental toughness is deﬁned by Middleton, Marsh, Martin, Richards and Perry (1997) as “an unshake- able perseverance and conviction towards some goal despite pressure or adversity”. Jones, Hanton and Connaughton (2002) state that it is, “the natural or developed psychological edge that enables you to generally cope better than your opponents with the many demands that sport places on a performer” So mental toughness is about being able to cope under pressure and not giving into it. So does mental toughness help in a rehabilitative setting?Mentally tough individuals have been shown to demonstrate a greater ability to withstand physical pain (Jones et al.2002) and to recover more quickly from injury (Gucciardi et al 2008). In addition, mentally tough participants perceive their injury to be less severe, feel that they are less sus- ceptible to further injury and focus less on their pain during the course of their rehabilitation (Levy et al.2006). Perhaps surprisingly, even greater attendance at rehabilitation sessions is demonstrated by those with greater mental toughness (Levy et al."}

To start with, you need to be aware of the relationship be- tween stress and injury because you are in a key posi- tion to identify and help athletes who are at a greater risk of injury. As a sports rehabilitator it is useful to understand how personality affects the stress process and how an athlete’s past can affect how they deal with a stressful situation. As a sports rehabilitator, you are in a good position to encourage athletes to improve their coping strategies in handling stressful major life events as well as in handling daily has- sles (Johnson et al.2005). By catering to the emo- tional and behavioural needs of your athlete you are more likely to offer a comprehensive treatment that will enable your athlete to be stronger both psycho- logically and physiologically. Recovery can also be optimised through adherence and mental toughness. Finally, Tracey (2003) points out that the expe- rience of injury can give an athlete an increased understanding that recovery is a process in which an athlete can reﬂect and grow emotionally. You, as a rehabilitator, are often in a unique position to become involved in developing intervention programmes for athletes. There have been a variety of psychological interventions identiﬁed which facilitate adjustment to injury, such as goal setting, imagery and stress management (Evans et al."}
{"id": "1590", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2000; Johnson 2000; Johnson et al.2005). Interventions in terms of psychological skills training and how they can be used will now be explained. Psychological skills training in the injury process The injury process may be simplistically divided into the time before an injury (pre-injury period), and the time following injury, lasting until the performer is fully rehabilitated and ready to return to activity (rehabilitation period). The role of psychological skills training (PST) in each stage will be outlined in this section. It is important to recognise that while the physical therapist or sports rehabilitator is not a sport psychologist, they are still in a good place to encourage injured athletes to practice mentally, and to give them some basic tips about how to do so (Gordon et al.1998). This part of the chapter in- forms you about what psychological skills are, and how they may help prevent injury as well as support injury rehabilitation. You will notice that imagery is mentioned more frequently than other psychologi- cal skills; this is only because there is more research into its role and effectiveness. But, one study found that of a number of psychological skills, people ac- tually rate goal setting as their favourite (Brewer et al."}
{"id": "1591", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "1994). This means that it might be easier to “sell” goal setting to the people you meet; perhaps because it feels like a very practical and not overly ‘psychological’ technique. Still, the best approach is probably to recommend a variety of psychological skills to injured performers, so that they can choose what suits them best. If you are interested in explor- ing this topic further, a chapter by Kolt (2000) gives a very interesting example of how physical and psy- chological treatment following ACL reconstruction can go hand in hand. For additional material, see the books on the psychological aspects of injury by Pargman (2007), Taylor and Taylor (1997), and Heil (1993). Psychological skills and psychological skills training Psychological skills (sometimes called mental skills) include goal setting, imagery, self-talk and various forms of relaxation, and PST (or mental skills train- ing, MST) is simply the systematic training of such skills. For example, a hockey coach who does a bit of informal goal setting with his team in order to pre- pare for the upcoming season would be said to use the psychological skill of goal setting. If, instead, he designs and implements a programme of goal setting over a number of weeks, perhaps teaching his ath- letes about how to make goal setting effective and evaluating it at the end, he could be said to be im- plementing a PST programme. As you might imag- ine, the effects of the various psychological skills are greater when implemented systematically; therefore, it is a good idea to learn more about, and regularly practice, these skills. You might also be wonder- ing which psychological skill is ‘best’, or whether you have to study and practise (or recommend) them all."}

{"id": "1593", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "284 PSYCHOLOGY AND SPORTS REHABILITATION straightforward question, the answer is that there is no known ‘optimal recipe’ for how to use PST. Some researchers examine only one skill, and some examine several; however, because of the enormous number of sports, age groups, study purposes, and potential combinations of psychological skills avail- able, there is no easy way in which to answer the question of which psychological skills to practice. But do not worry, sport psychologists often recom- mend a number of different skills, or combinations of skills, to performers. This way, the performer can choose what works best for them and their particular circumstances, and the chances of success are opti- mised. The individual psychological skills will now be introduced in turn. Goal setting Goal setting is a process of planning ahead for what one wants, and how to get there. This means that there is a huge variety of potential goals both for “normal”, healthy sports participation and for reha- bilitation. For instance, for one athlete, a rehabili- tation goal might be to be back on form by the last game of the season, while others take a more process- oriented approach and set themselves the goal of do- ing their rehabilitation exercises three times daily. Even if you haven’t studied much goal setting, you may still have heard a common acronym for how goal setting is made effective; this is the SMART acronym, which indicates that goals should be spe- ciﬁc, measurable, accurate, realistic, and timed (Cox 2001; Weinberg and Gould 2007). It is important that most goals set are focused on individual per- formance (e.g. re-gaining complete strength of an injured leg) and the processes that contribute to this (e.g. doing three sets of eight reps of the rehabilita- tion exercises daily for three weeks)."}
{"id": "1594", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Such process and performance goals are superior to setting mainly outcome goals (e.g. returning faster from injury than another injured player, so that you will be the one to make the team; Filby, Maynard and Graydon 1999). This is so because outcome goals depend to some extent on factors outside your control, and may con- tribute to lowered self-conﬁdence and heightened anxiety. Individually appropriate and relevant goals set jointly between the performer and their rehabil- itator and, where appropriate, a coach, will instead promote a sense of control (Taylor and Taylor 1997). In rehabilitation, goal setting is one of the favourite methods for athletes to ‘get back on track’ (Brewer et al.1994; Durso Cupal 1998). Imagery Imagery is the creation, or re-creation, of experi- ences in your mind (White and Hardy 1998). It may involve one or more senses, such as seeing yourself perform a particular exercise, feeling muscles move, and so on. Most imagery work in sport focuses on fairly concrete imagery to do with oneself (e.g. a gymnast imaging herself completing a ﬂoor routine), but more abstract, metaphorical images have also been reported, especially in the literature on healing imagery (Korn 1983; Ievleva and Orlick 1991; Green 1992; Evans et al.2006) and in artistic activities like dance (Hanrahan and Vergeer 2000; Nordin and Cumming 2005). In metaphorical imagery, a performer might imagine the hip joint moving as a wheel or imagine toxins as a black substance that are gradually rinsed out or diluted with the breath – in other words, actions that are not strictly accurate but that may support a person’s understanding of a movement, induce relaxation, or similar."}
{"id": "1595", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The types of imagery that performers may use during rehabilitation include all those experi- enced in their everyday lives (including seeing and feeling how they perform certain skills so that they don’t forget how to do them while ‘out’ with an injury). However, performers have also been found to engage in healing-type images when injured (Driediger et al.2006; Evans et al.2006; Green 1992; Hanrahan and Vergeer 2000; Ievleva and Orlick 1991; Korn 1983; Milne et al.2005; Nordin and Cumming 2005; Sordoni et al.2000, 2002; Short et al.2004). Healing imagery might include metaphorical images such as those described above, but also more concrete images of physiological processes related to healing, such as tissue repairing itself back to normal. While healing imagery ap- pears to have positive results, be mindful that people sometimes have strong preferences when it comes to imagery types. For example, some people respond really well to images of white blood cells eating local irritants and of cleansing, white air entering the lungs and circulation."}
{"id": "1596", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "For others, such abstract imagery might feel far-fetched or airy-fairy.

Offering a menu of images, ranging from strictly anatomical to very abstract, might be a good idea, as is having examples and anecdotes of how such images have been helpful to other clients at the ready. For those who work with injured performers (e.g. physiotherapists, sports physicians, sports rehabili- tators) to encourage their clients to use imagery ef- fectively, they must clearly ﬁrst learn about how im- agery can be used to assist injured athletes (Driediger et al.2006). In addition, having tried it out yourself ﬁrst is essential. One useful approach is for the reha- bilitator to link imagery in relation to injury with the imagery that an athlete likely already does as part of their training. For example, you could ask them to describe how they rehearse sport skills, strate- gies, and scenarios in their mind around competi- tion, and then say that imagery in the rehabilitation process is really similar. This should help reassure the athlete that they already have the requisite skills to do rehabilitation imagery. If you inform them that healing imagery has been shown to be effective in well-controlled research studies, it might also help dispel some of the uncertainty or apprehension about a form of imagery that is perhaps less intuitive than simple mental rehearsal (Morris et al.2005; Wiese et al."}
{"id": "1598", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "1991). Self-talk The cognitive process of talking to oneself is simply referred to as self-talk. Like imagery, it is a basic form of thought and most of us do it all the time – although more or less consciously. Self-talk may be positive, negative, or neutral in nature (Hardy et al.2001.2005), and although some athletes report that negative self-talk is motivating for them (Van Raalte et al.1995; Hardy et al.2001), mostly the research ﬁndings are as you might guess; that is, more positive results come from positive self-talk, and more nega- tive results come from negative self-talk (see Hardy (2006) for a more in-depth discussion). Positive self- talk includes generally motivating statements like “I know I can do this!”,whilst negative self-talk might include statements such as “she gave me just too many rehabilitation exercises – I will never be able to do them all every day”."}
{"id": "1599", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Neutral self-talk may be instructional in nature, including statements such as “arm in line with body, shoulders relaxed”, perhaps designed to help remember and execute a shoulder rehabilitation exercise correctly. Relaxation Whilst a number of PST ‘packages’ include relax- ation, it is rarely investigated on its own in sport psychology; thus, the number of studies examining the effects of relaxation for injured performers are few and far between. Even so, relaxation is a widely used technique that appeals to many performers, as most people intuitively appreciate the feeling of be- ing calm and relaxed. A number of ways of achieving a relaxation response exist, and we will not describe them all here; instead, we will limit ourselves to a brief outline of some methods that are typically em- ployed in PST programmes. Note also that while the sport psychology literature typically refers to re- laxation ‘techniques’ or ‘procedures’, many people have developed their own ways of relaxing; for in- stance just by breathing deeply, by listening to mu- sic, or by doing yoga or another form of calming exercise. One of the best known of the established tech- niques is progressive relaxation, ﬁrst proposed by Jacobson in 1929. In this technique, the performer ﬁrst contracts a particular muscle group, and there- after relaxes it. This way, it is proposed that the athlete will learn to distinguish between the feelings of tension and relaxation. It is notable that imagery seems to play a part in progressive relaxation; that is, a typical progressive relaxation script would guide the participant’s attention toward the feeling of their muscles relaxing, in a suggestive fashion. For exam- ple, a script used by Gill, Kolt, and Keating (2004, p292) tells participants to “Relax your feet and lower legs."}
{"id": "1600", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Be aware of the tension being released. Release all the tension. As the tension fades away, focus on the new relaxed feeling in your feet and lower legs. Continue to focus on this feeling.”Another form of relaxation is autogenic training, created by psychia- trist Johannes Schultz in 1932. It is somewhat similar to progressive relaxation, with both techniques go- ing through various parts of the body and involving imagery as well as suggestive statements concerning the body being relaxed. Different from progressive relaxation, however, autogenic training focuses on limbs being warm and heavy, and typically also fo- cuses more on the regulation of heart rate, breathing, and temperature (Cox 2002; Noh and Morris 2004)."}
{"id": "1601", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "286 PSYCHOLOGY AND SPORTS REHABILITATION Combined PST As noted above, many studies as well as real-life in- terventions use psychological skills in combination. The following examples give you some idea of how that might be done: r use self-talk to guide yourself through an imagery sequence r imagine yourself achieving a goal r setting a goal to do imagery for 10 minutes daily in order to enhance performance r use self-talk to remind yourself of your goals r and if you have learnt a relaxation procedure, sim- ply thinking through that procedure would be a form of self-talk, as you would be telling yourself what to do!Coping skills Some researchers into PST and injury have looked at the concept of coping skills. Indeed, coping re- sources are a key component of the Williams and Andersen (1998) model of stress and athletic injury described above. Somewhat similar to psychologi- cal skills, coping skills typically include goal set- ting and/or another form of mental preparation, but also deals with constructs such as coping with ad- versity, peaking under pressure, concentration, free- dom from worry, conﬁdence, achievement motiva- tion, and coachability (Smith et al.1995). In other words, having good coping skills means that a athlete would handle a variety of situations in a conﬁdent, capable way and be resilient to setbacks. Note that while these coping skills should help a performer cope with varying circumstances, the psychological skills literature would typically argue that charac- teristics such as concentration, self-conﬁdence, and freedom from worry and excessive anxiety, and may be achieved through PST. For example, goal setting might be used to improve a footballer’s anxiety lev- els, or imagery might be employed for a runner who would like to improve her self-conﬁdence. So what does all this mean for you in practice?"}
{"id": "1602", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Well, simply that it is important to be clear about what it is you want to achieve (e.g. being able to cope with adver- sity, such as returning from a debilitating, long-term injury), and the techniques that might be available to help you do so (e.g. the psychological skills of goal setting, imagery, self-talk and relaxation). Psychological skills training in the pre-injury period One of the most fascinating ﬁndings that have emerged in recent years is that psychological skills training can help performers avoid injury. The ﬁnd- ings related to injury prevention fall into two cate- gories: reduced injury frequency, and reduced injury duration. Reduced injury frequency The existing research indicates that a multitude of positive beneﬁts stand to be obtained from PST, in- cluding preventing injuries from happening in the ﬁrst place (Davis 1991; Johnson et al.2005; Kerr and Goss 1996; Kolt et al.2004; May and Brown 1989; Perna et al.2003; Schomer 1990). In one study, a relaxation and imagery intervention reduced injury by as much as 52% (Davis 1991). Intervention stud- ies have used various combinations of psychologi- cal skills and stress inoculation training (essentially training performers to handle stress better over time) to reduce injury frequency. And although this means that we do not have a very clear idea of which psy- chological skill does what, it also suggests that the effect is fairly robust."}
{"id": "1603", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Moreover, the activities used in the various studies have included soccer (Johnson et al.2005), alpine skiing (May and Brown 1989), swimming (Davis 1991), gymnastics (Kerr and Goss 1996; Kolt et al.2004), rowing (Perna et al.2003) and marathon running (Schomer 1990); this diversity further suggests that the ﬁndings are not anomalous, unique or sport-speciﬁc. Instead, the studies indicate that the effect is due to PST helping athletes lower their stress levels, feel more conﬁdent and optimistic, becoming more aware of their bodies, and building their ability to cope with difﬁculties. Reduced injury duration In a study by Noh, Morris, and Andersen (2005), it was shown that ballet dancers’ psychological skills and coping strategies distinguished between not just"}

Speciﬁcally, dancers with shorter injury duration reported less worry and negative stress. They also had greater levels of conﬁdence and achievement motivation. These authors later used their ﬁndings to conduct an intervention study, again with ballet dancers (Noh et al.2007). After teaching one group imagery, self-talk and autogenic training (a form of relaxation), the group improved not only their coping skills, but also spent less time injured than a control group. Another study in rugby yielded similar ﬁndings (Maddison and Prapavessis 2005). In their study, rugby players considered to have an “at-risk psychological proﬁle for injury” were identi- ﬁed and undertook a stress management programme. Like the ballet dancers in Noh et al.’s (2007) study, these rugby players gained better coping skills, wor- ried less and spent less time injured than a control group."}

Make sure they are SMART in nature, and focus more on yourself and your own progress than on how you compare to others. Get regular feedback from knowledgeable people (e.g. coaches) on your progress, and use this as well as your own judgment to keep goals ﬂexible, and to evaluate progress. A training diary is a useful tool to help you keep track of goals and progress.2. Use imagery daily. Explore imagery in all its forms – play around with different types and use it for a range of purposes – improving performance and conﬁdence, reducing stress, and focusing you on your goals. For example, you can imagine yourself performing technical skills in detail, rehearse strategies for how to get out of potential ‘trouble’ (e.g. being a player down), imagine each component of a game the night before to ensure that you are prepared, see yourself reaching your overall goal, or use metaphorical images to enhance the quality of your performance.

Use self-talk to your advantage. Make sure that your inner chatter is beneﬁcial to your performance as well as to your well-being. Having positive self-talk statements ‘ready-made’ is one of the best ways of banishing negative statements if and when they surface; focus your attention on your positive statement, and repeat it over and over if necessary. With time, you will identify negative self-talk quickly and get rid of it just as quickly. In addition, you can use instructional self-talk to focus your attention on the task at hand; for example, a tired runner might feel her mind wander, thereby risking injury due to not focusing on the terrain underfoot. By repeating instructional statements to herself (e.g. feedback from her coach such as ‘shoulders loose, arms swinging freely’ or metaphors such as ‘light as a cheetah’), she keeps her attention in the here-and-now.4."}

You might also want to use relaxation to improve your body awareness – for instance, what parts of your body typically tense up?Why might that be?Is there something you need to change in your exercise, sport, or everyday habits to improve it?It seems likely that being able to relax helps prevent injury through removing excess tension, stress and anxiety, and perhaps through improved body awareness."}

For example, rehabilitation may be acceler- ated with negative emotional experiences minimised and positive emotions maximised; it can activate coping strategies, enhance readiness for return to activity and maintain conﬁdence. These positive out- comes will now be addressed. Shorter recovery times Studies have shown that athletes who recover more quickly from an injury use more psychological skills than those who recover more slowly (Ievleva and Or- lick 1991). In this particular study, goal setting, pos- itive self-talk and healing imagery were the skills that set the faster healers apart. For example, fast healers spoke to themselves in optimistic terms (e.g. “I can do anything”) while those who healed more slowly spoke to themselves more pessimistically (e.g. “What a stupid thing to do”). Fast healers also reported experiencing fewer replay-images of their injury. In other words, it seems that imagery is ca- pable of both slowing recovery down, and speeding it up, suggesting that performers should take care to engage only in facilitative, constructive images. It is possible that the shorter recovery times are a result of better rehabilitation adherence and/or en- hanced healing and physical functioning, and these potential beneﬁts are described next. Greater adherence with rehabilitation schedules As mentioned above, a key concern for the reha- bilitator is how to make performers stick with the recommendations and exercises given to them."}

For instance, it has been found that goal setting increases the extent to which athletes reha- bilitating from ACL-reconstruction actually do the home exercises given to them (Scherzer et al.2001). These same authors also found goal setting to im- prove the work of these athletes while in the clinic; that is, they worked with greater intensity, and ad- hered to directions better. Positive self-talk was also associated with adherence. Although Scherzer et al. (2001) did not ﬁnd healing imagery to be related to adherence, other studies have (Gould et al.1997; Jones and Stuth 1997). Still others have found that management of thoughts and emotions (as is done when using PST) sets those who rehabilitate success- fully apart from those who do not (Udry et al.1997)."}

A handful of intervention studies have also examined whether teaching injured athletes’ psychological skills can improve aspects of their healing and/or physical functioning, with promising results. For instance, relaxation practice and/or imagery can reduce pain sensations or help increase athletes’ pain tolerance (Broucek et al.1993; Cupal and Brewer 2001; Nicol 1993; Ross and Berger 1996; Sthalekar 1993)."}

Participants were also less anxious about re-injuring themselves, and gained greater knee strength than two other groups: one no-intervention control group, and one placebo group who received attention and encouragement, but no PST. This is important, because few studies have a design strong enough to allow us to conclude that PST is truly more effective than simply spend- ing time with an athlete.

In a qualitative interview study with rehabilitating athletes, Evans et al. (2006) provided some support for this idea, and suggested that imagery may change from the early to the late stages of rehabilitation, and as a result of stress. In their study, athletes used imagery of skills to promote self-conﬁdence, while images of healing and pain management helped the rehabilitation process. As an example, consider the following quote from a male semi-professional soccer player with a cartilaginous knee injury: I can see the joint itself, I can see the bones, I can see the ligaments, I can imagine where the cartilage is. Once I’ve actually got that image in my mind I’ll actually focus on the point where I feel the pain. .. I turn it into a color.

Once I’ve got that blue, I just imagine a cold icy feeling right, which I think tends to help the actual pain at that particular moment. ("}

Another set of psychological skills were used by Beneka and colleagues, who investigated the muscu- lar performance of knee injured athletes during reha- bilitation (Beneka et al.2000). It was found that ath- letes taught to use goal setting and self-talk did better at this test than those taught to use just one. How- ever, it was more beneﬁcial to use either goal setting or self-talk than to do no PST. Theodorakis and his colleagues have further established the effectiveness of goal setting in enhancing rehabilitation perfor- mance. In two separate studies, it was found that teaching participants to set personally relevant goals enhanced strength (Theodorakis et al.1996, 1997). Reduced fear and anxiety When injured, performers often suffer from undesir- able fear and anxiety (see earlier section of this chap- ter on the psychological reactions to injury)."}

For example, it has been found that teenage female gymnasts fear getting injured because it is difﬁcult to return from injury, and because being injured pre- vents them from participating in their sport (Chase et al.2005). Importantly, this study also established that psychological skills such as imagery and relax- ation could help them overcome such fears. A case study with a skier (Suinn 1975) found similar results. We know from rehabilitation experts (Udry et al.1997; Karin 2008) that athletes can often return from injury not only physically stronger, but also techni- cally better than they previously were. Highlight to performers, therefore, that injury is an almost in- escapable part of sustained high-level participation and it should not be seen as inherently negative. In- stead, becoming an expert at injury rehabilitation may be one of the factors that set true high-achievers apart from those who are less able to achieve at a high level. Alerting athletes to this idea, coupled with stories about successfully rehabilitated athletes and PST, may help reduce fear and anxiety."}

As an exam- ple, Johnson (2000) has shown that a combination of relaxation and imagery can enhance mood among competitive athletes with long-term injuries. Ath- letes who received this intervention were also more ready to return to competition, as judged both by themselves and the physiotherapist treating them. Intriguingly, Johnson’s (2000) study indicated that the intervention group receiving relaxation and im- agery training was the only one to yield statistically signiﬁcant improvements: those receiving training in stress management and cognitive control, or in goal-setting, did not. Further support for the role of imagery comes from research by Sordoni, Hall and Forwell (2002). In their study, it was found that heal- ing imagery was positively related to rehabilitation self-efﬁcacy. In other words, those who did more healing imagery felt more capable of rehabilitating successfully. Evans, Hare and Mullen (2006) found rehabilitating athletes to use images of sport skills to enhance their conﬁdence."}

So, to try and keep things in perspective you kind of imagine how they’re going to help you get back to competition level. (Driediger et al.,2006, p. 265). Feeling involved in one’s sport, and maintaining sport skills PST can help an injured performer to feel involved in their sport, rather than left out and unable to do anything to progress athletically. It can also sup- port the maintenance of sport skills, thereby helping athletes return to activity at a good level of proﬁ- ciency (Ievleva and Orlick 1991; Evans et al.2006). Consider, for example, the following quote from a male international pole vaulter who had used a lot of imagery during his rehabilitation from a muscular compression injury on his lower back. Without any physical training, he won a National Championship immediately upon his return to activity: I’ve done so much imagery between getting injured and now, it’s just, erm, I’m still a lot closer to the real performance than I would be if I had done nothing. I think that that maybe the reason behind the suc- cessful performance in the competition last week, in that, I mean, even though I’d been 2 months without any training at all, you know it just kinda came natu- rally to me, it was amazing, technically I hadn’t lost a thing.

Athletes should be informed that really, rehabili- tation is a busy time - if they choose it to be. For ex- ample, practicing their rehabilitation exercises and practicing mentally is training that can help them progress as athletes. Importantly, more elite perform- ers are likely to do this automatically, while athletes at lower levels may need more inspiration and sup- port (Sordoni et al.2002). Athletes can be encour- aged to do imagery not only at home but also in the practice setting; by sitting in on practices, helping out (perhaps by support-coaching others), and learning new skills using their imagery skills, an athlete will be in a much better position to return to activity when physically strong enough (White and Hardy 1998; Evans et al.2000; Kolt 2000). The idea of doing imagery in the “right” setting is one of seven recom- mendations for how to make imagery effective based on the PETTLEP model (Holmes and Collins 2001). Other important considerations raised by this model is that imagery should be multisensory (kinaesthetic imagery appears especially valuable), performed in real time, and be updated as a performer improves."}
{"id": "1619", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Emphasise that commitment to PST is an important aspect of commitment to sport in general, and that by doing it, the athletes will return to sport faster. Sometimes, injured performers experience debil- itative images, such as replaying the injury scenario over and over (Ievleva and Orlick 1991; Nordin and Cumming 2005; Evans et al.2006). It is important to realise that this kind of imagery might actually slow down the rehabilitation process (Ievleva and Orlick 1991), and should be avoided. Like with self- talk, the best way of avoiding unwanted images is to have a supply of vivid, positive and helpful im- ages available. This “supply” will only exist if such images have been practised, and so knowing what images help is extra important for this reason. When rehearsed, the performer will gradually be able to identify debilitative images, and replace them with facilitative ones. Some general points to consider In order for an athlete or rehabilitator to implement successful PST programmes, there are some further points to note. These include self-determination and injury understanding, which are outlined in turn. Self-determination As self-determination theory is gaining more and more research support, it is becoming increasingly evident how important it is to encourage a sense of self-determination in all aspects of sports and performing, and the injury process is no exception (Podlog and Eklund 2007)."}
{"id": "1620", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "As noted by Duda et al. (2005) and Hardy (2006), PST is likely to be more effective if performers feel that they have a say. A rehabilitator should therefore be knowledgeable enough about psychological skills to be able to advise performers, yet encouraging them to be working in an active, autonomous, self-determined way. This might involve an athlete actively gener- ating their own self-statements, images, and goals that have relevance to them. Injury understanding As noted by numerous researchers and practitioners (Taylor and Taylor 1997; Green 1999; Williams et al.2001; Morris et al.2005; Evans et al.2006), an"}
{"id": "1621", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "SOME GENERAL POINTS TO CONSIDER 291 accurate understanding of injury type, severity, prospects and anatomical structures should aid the rehabilitating athlete in numerous ways. For instance, it should enhance imagery accuracy, and therefore effectiveness (Heil 1993; Price and Andersen 2000). Similarly, a good understanding of one’s injury will help the athlete set effective, self-determined goals related to injury rehabilitation (O’Connor et al.2005). This may be achieved in a number of ways, and the rehabilitator should make every effort to interest the athlete in better understanding their relevant anatomy, physiology, and exercise requirements – skills that are likely to be useful to them even after the injury has healed, and helping to prevent re-injury. Pictures, anatom- ical models and drawings, websites, animations, interesting anecdotes, variations on exercises and a generally positive outlook are skills and techniques that may be beneﬁcial. Francis, Andersen and Maley (2000) report that athletes often appreciate having a timeline, ranging from the present to full recovery; this will undoubtedly facilitate accurate goal setting. Sample PST programme to rehabilitate from injury 1. Set goals for recovery. Use information from therapists and coaches to set up a realistic rehabilitation schedule."}
{"id": "1622", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Then break down your long-term goal (e.g. being back to playing 100%) into shorter-term goals. You may need to do this in several steps; you know you have “done it” when your schedule tells you what to do tomorrow!Set goals that include work such as your rehabilitation exercises (e.g. leg circles each morning and evening), mental practice (e.g. 5 minutes of imagery 3x/day) and fun things (e.g. see teammates socially at least once/week). Get your coach and any rehabilitation personnel to give you regular feedback on how you are doing, and bear in mind that goals often need updating as you go along – so stay ﬂexible. Again, a training diary can help you do all this.2. Use imagery daily. Use imagery to rehearse sport skills and scenarios and to support the healing process. It is a good idea to imagine yourself as healed, strong, and back in action; however, it might be even better to create realistic, gradual images of being stronger and stronger, with less and less pain. Rehearse reactions to pain, and any functional limitations you may expect to have initially."}
{"id": "1623", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Most importantly, imagine how you want to cope with such limitations. And don’t forget to generate feelings of conﬁdence throughout!Imagery is a great way to rehearse emotion as well as more “concrete” things like movements. For healing, try imagining ultrasound as a healing glow or your pain receptors shutting down as a result of ice treatment (Heil 1993), or your pain being washed away by water or your blood (Ievleva and Orlick 1991). You can also imagine “breathing into” an area to induce relaxation and a feeling of space in joints. An imagery script that also includes a relaxation procedure is available in Price and Andersen (2000).3. Use self-talk to your advantage. Monitor your internal dialogue during rehabilitation, ensuring it stays constructive. Use it to improve performance in your rehabilitation exercises and perhaps while observing or imagining training sessions, and use it to boost your mood and to maintain your conﬁdence throughout the day."}

Relax -- you deserve it!During rehabilitation, being able to relax is an important skill – especially for performers who are prone to stress. Not only can it help you identify (and release) any excess tension that you are carrying, but it can also help you tune into your body and thereby enhancing awareness – a valuable skill also after the injury is gone."}

Through successful accomplishments your athlete will feel a sense of achievement, autonomy and competence. It is helpful for an athlete to maintain an optimistic view especially as within the rehabilitative process there are often setbacks Refer This pertains to an ethical and moral sense of obligation by you, the sports rehabilitator, of the importance of referring to a sport psychologist or GP for more serious issues such as depression, anxiety or eating disorders. This is also another reason why studying psychology is important for rehabilitators: by understanding more about psychological issues, you will be in a better place to know when you can help an athlete, and when they need more specialist support Accommodate This refers to being ﬂexible and adjusting to the patient’s needs and wants. Beware of relying on standardised approaches, and make every effort to develop an individualised programme that suits the athlete Psychological skills These include strategies such as imagery, relaxation and goal setting. The use of a diary is beneﬁcial in helping the athlete to keep a record of progress and feelings, and can also include instructions for physical and psychological exercises Educate The need to educate each client about their speciﬁc injury and rehabilitation process is paramount. Therefore, this part of the SCRAPE acronym refers to the giving of material (e.g. photocopied pictures of exercises) explaining the nature of the injury or what is required for the treatment or the length of the process Bringing it all together: the SCRAPE model of psychological aspects of recovery This chapter has contained a lot of information, and you may be wondering how to remember it all. Fortunately, help is at hand through SCRAPE: a model (Hinderliter and Cardinal 2007), which may help you as a sport rehabilitator to easily re- member the psychological aspects of recovery. The acronym stands for six concepts representing sports rehabilitation recovery, including social support, conﬁdence and competence, refer, accommodate, psychological skills and educate. The model is based on Hinderliter and Cardinal’s (2007) own research as well as their clinical experiences."}

It will help you develop your thinking skills as you progress your reading throughout the book. By the end of this chapter you will be able to locate and explain the role and efﬁcacy of clinical reasoning skills within a professional practice domain. This will inform an appreciation for the complex nature of knowledge construction in relation to clinical explanation and judgement. By considering clinical reasoning as a functional skill set, you will further be in a posi- tion to explain different models of reasoning and ask structured questions in an attempt to better for- mulate and construct answers to clinical questions, issues and decisions. The chapter will further en- courage the use of problem solving and clinical reasoning skills to justify substantially, through re- search evidence, professional practice actions and outcomes. To adequately deﬁne, discuss and synthesise clin- ical reasoning and its application to healthcare prac- tices, it is important to relate evidence-based learning and decision making to the skills and competencies of the sports rehabilitator. Understanding clinical reasoning It is what we think we know that keeps us from learning (Claude Bernard) Members of the professions must build and maintain a formidable store of knowledge and skills; they must learn to absorb information through various senses and to assess its validity, reliability and relevance; and they must acquire the art and culture of their calling. And most importantly, they must learn to use these qualities to solve practical problems (Heath 1990, cited in Higgs and Jones 1995). In considering the above it is apparent that clini- cal reasoning and the application and synthesis of clinical knowledge is at best an obscure and com- plex phenomenon."}

Reasoning involves the processes of cognition and metacognition. In sports rehabilitation, clinical reasoning skills are an ex- pected component of expert and competent practice. Interprofessional health research, predominantly from nursing practices, have identiﬁed concepts, pro- cesses andthinkingstrategies that might underpinthe clinical reasoning used by healthcare professionals. Much of the available research on reasoning is based on the use of the think aloud approach. Although this is a useful method, it is dependent on ability to describe and verbalise the reasoning process (Schon 1991; Hauer et al.2007). Information-processing theory, developed by Newell and Simon (1972), is useful in explaining and describing how to organise information using knowledge, and experience, and the use of cognitive processes to resolve a problem. Rather than analysing how a problem ought to be solved, or a decision made, this theory describes decision making as an open system of interaction between a problem solver and a task (Ericsson and Simon 1984; Simmons et al.2003)."}
{"id": "1656", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "This theory is useful in helping to describe and categorise the or- ganisation of problem solving and decision making for clinical reasoning development. According to Simmons et al. (2003), when applied in healthcare settings, the term information processing becomes interchangeable with clinical reasoning. Is clinical reasoning simply the collection and collation of data in an attempt to provide answers to often complex questions?Is it the barrier between expertise knowledge and novice enterprise?Or is clinical reasoning and subsequent applications, a more involved process of knowing, appraising and deciding how best to answer?In support of the later, the area of evidence- based learning captures the nature of clinical enquiry through a simple question: What is the best possible answer that can be given based on current knowl- edge levels?This question triggers a complex cere- bral cascade that demands substantiated support, of- ten through scientiﬁc and research driven processes, to arrive at an answer that fully and comprehensibly details a speciﬁc knowledge cluster. It is this process of thinking through reason that allows a clinician to consolidate, appreciate and apply knowledge in relation to clinical challenges. The literature is ﬂooded with examples and ex- tensions of clinical and problem-solving skills and decisions, with an array of application and analysis."}
{"id": "1657", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Despite this, there is no one accepted evidence-based research model to adequately explain; or account for all aspects of clinical reasoning practices. There are a number of models that attempt to explain the inter- dependent process of thinking through reasoning to arrive at an informed answer to substantiate action. Fleming and Mattingly (1994), argue that clinical reasoning in its most simple form is “judgement in action” leading to “action based upon judgement”. Models of clinical reasoning Appreciating the challenge and process of clini- cal reasoning, often demands an understanding and analysis of models of clinical reasoning. The generation of hypotheses based on clinical data and knowledge, coupled with the testing of these hypotheses through further inquiry, forms the basis of the hypothetico-deductive reasoning model (Elstein et al.1978; Kassirer and Gorry 1978; Gale 1982). Hypothesis generation and testing involves both inductive (considering a speciﬁc observation and moving to a more general view), and deductive (moving from a generalised view to a more speciﬁc and pronounced outcome) reasoning (Ridderrikhoff, 1989). Induction is a reasoning process used in the formulation of hypotheses, whereas deduction is used to test the hypothesis. Inductive reasoning is probabilistic in nature, since a conclusion is reached and the presented evidence is evaluated in relation to existing knowledge (Albert et al.1988)."}
{"id": "1658", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Deductive reasoning is widely used in sports rehabilitation practice to defend decisions and actions. A second explanation of how reasoning is used to support actions and decisions is contained within a pattern recognition approach. Pattern recognition, or more precisely inductive reasoning, as an inter- pretation and expression of diagnostic reasoning has received much support in the literature (Hamilton 1966; Gorry 1970; Elstein et al.1990). This reasoning approach allows more experienced practitioners to arrange their thought processes into patterned formations. This development of pattern formation allows for heuristic analysis in clinical judgements. Pattern recognition further allows clin- icians to draw on past treatments, to better evaluate their effectiveness, and categorise the success of the treatment into a management plan for the treatment of a similar or recurring condition.

A third approach to explain the reasoning pro- cess is best presented in the work of Boshuizen and Schmidt (1992), who developed a stage theory on the development of expertise that emphasises the paral- lel development of knowledge acquisition and clini- cal reasoning expertise. This model is based on the notion that the construction of knowledge and sub- sequent expertise is largely the result in changes to knowledge structure and development. The approach has been described as a knowledge-reasoning inte- gration."}
{"id": "1660", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Figure 16.1 outlines the reasoning approach and provides a reasoning map for clinical decision making. Leaver-Dunn, Harrelson, Martin and Wyatt (2002), investigated the tendency of undergraduate athletic training students to think critically. Their re- search ﬁndings provide some useful considerations in terms of understanding critical thinking as a pre- cursor to clinical reasoning. In their study, they em- ployed an objective measure called the California critical thinking disposition inventory to quantita- tively measure critical thinking. The inventory has a number of subscales, which depict the components of critical analysis. The weakest subscale was that of truth seeking, which highlights the ability of a critical thinker to reﬂect on knowledge and engage a quest to ﬁnd the truth irrespective of current views. The reasons attributed to the weakness in the truth scale could be explained by emphasising the need to know the correct answer as opposed to understand- ing the reasons for the correct answer and the ability to reﬂect on the answers reached. Whilst this chapter does not explore critical thinking as a separate entity to clinical reasoning, knowledge of critical analysis and reﬂection is central to developing skills neces- sary for understanding clinical decisions and actions. Development of clinical reasoning skills Problem based learning One possible approach to teaching and developing reasoning skills is problem based learning (PBL). PBL has its history ﬁrmly rooted within the teaching and education of medical practitioners although its application to other disciplines has been researched and documented (Wood 2003)."}
{"id": "1661", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "PBL evolved through two assumptions: the ﬁrst was that learning through problem solving is more effective than memory based learning for creating a usable body of knowl- edge; the second was that clinical skills, which are important for patient treatment are problem solving skills not necessarily memory skills. PBL is not a method as much as a total teaching approach and re- ﬂects the way learners learn in real life situations. It has been used in varied study contexts to develop critical analysis and thought, as well as problem solving skills (Duncan et al.2007). Through the use of PBL within the sports rehabilitation curriculum, it is hypothesised that the cardinal skills of criti- cal thinking, analysis and application will develop leading to greater levels of student intrinsic motiva- tion. Using PBL with undergraduate students could enable the growth and evolution of critical analysis (Martin et al.2008). One of the primary features of PBL is that it is student-centred. This refers to learn- ing opportunities that are relevant to the students, the goals of which are at least partly determined by"}

Creating assignments and activities that require student input also increases the likelihood of students being motivated to learn (Richardson 2005). A common criticism of student- centred learning is that students, as novices, cannot be expected to know what might be important for them to learn, especially in a subject to which they appear to have no prior exposure. The literature on novice-expert learning does not entirely dispute this assertion; rather, it does emphasise that our students come to us, not as the proverbial blank slates, but as individuals whose prior learning can greatly im- pact their current learning. Problem based learning encourages students to use and develop knowledge by examining problems or case study scenarios in a relevant, real-life and applied context (Martin et al.2008). Like many of the teaching approaches, PBL needs to be used carefully, especially in the design of the problem. Savin-Baden (2003) noted that PBL is an approach to learning that is characterised by ﬂexibility and diversity, in the sense that it can be implemented in a variety of ways, across subjects and disciplines in diverse contexts. As such it can therefore look different to different people at differ- ent times, depending on the staff and students using it. What is unique and yet similar is the locus of learning around problem scenarios rather than dis- crete subject areas (Duncan et al."}
{"id": "1663", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2007). Savery (2006), notes that the widespread adop- tion of the PBL instructional approach by different disciplines, for different age levels, and in different content domains has produced some misapplications and misconceptions of PBL. Certain practices that are called PBL may fail to achieve the anticipated learning outcomes for a variety of reasons: r confusing PBL as an approach to curriculum de- sign with the teaching of problem-solving r adoption of a PBL proposal without sufﬁcient commitment of staff at all levels r lack of research and development on the nature and type of problems to be used r insufﬁcient investment in the design, preparation and ongoing renewal of learning resources r inappropriate assessment methods which do not match the learning outcomes sought in problem- based programmes r evaluation strategies that do not focus on the key learning issues and which are implemented and acted on far too late. Using PBL in developing clinical reasoning skills is useful. Unlike traditional information driven curric- ula, PBL begins with a problem, often based on real facts or simulations of real situations, and requires the student to work alone and in groups to ﬁnd solutions. The advantage is that real problems do not have simple solutions and require comparison and analysis of resources. As such the student develops skills of retrieval, selection and discrimination and applies these to reason through answers and solutions to problems (Duncan et al.2007). PBL is one way in which clinical reasoning skills can be developed. To develop an appreciation of the dynamics of PBL within the evolution of clinical reasoning skills, it is important to brieﬂy address two important con- cepts that directly impact this evolutionary process namely: Troublesome knowledge (TK) and thresh- old concepts (TCs)."}

Meyers and Land (2003) related a deﬁnitional construct of threshold concepts by outlining that in each discipline, such as sports rehabilitation, there are conceptual gateways or portals that must be ne- gotiated to arrive at important new understandings. In crossing the portal or threshold transformation oc- curs in both knowledge and subjectivity. Meyers and Land (2008) and Land et al.2008 expand this further by detailing the transformation as irreversible (no- going back) and integrative (involving the inclusion and fusion of different ideas and concepts in both detail and variation). Such transformation involves troublesome knowledge. Perkins (1999) referred to troublesome knowl- edge as knowledge that is alien or counter-intuitive, ritualised, inert, tacit or academically challenging. Perkin further relates that threshold concepts could lead to troublesome knowledge within their own rights.

The explanation of the ﬁeld of sports rehabilitation involves defending a scope of practice that is construed by some professionals and clinicians as alien, or a subset of physiotherapy prac- tice, yet surprisingly different. To fully consider ac- tion and decision making within sports rehabilitation and the ensuing development of clinical reasoning skills, it is fundamental that clinicians, academics and students, identify the threshold concepts and then use approaches such as PBL, to navigate TK and TCs to develop reﬂective ways of thinking and practice. The ability to think and reason like a pro- fessional clinician, is an important goal of the sports rehabilitation student. The model in Figure 16.2 integrates TCs and TKs into a clinical reasoning development framework and considers a 6-D approach in deﬁning conceptual dif- ﬁculties and thresholds.

To achieve this, learning must be aligned with understanding. The conceptual models align to illustrate the pro- cess of transformation and the traversing of TCs and TK. The true characteristics of a proﬁcient sports re- habilitator practitioner lie in the ability to cross thresholds, integrate new knowledge and construct bridges between the concepts to arrive at informed and evidence-based decisions and actions (Barrows and Pickell 1991). In a recent study by Hauer et al. (2007) on the effect of causal knowledge on judgments of the like- lihood of unknown features, the researchers reported that respondents perceived that technique problems in history taking and physical examination were readily correctable, but that poor performance result- ing from inadequate knowledge or poor clinical rea- soning ability was more difﬁcult to ameliorate. Inter- personal skill deﬁciencies, which often manifested as detachment from the patient, and professionalism problems attributed to lack of insight, were mostly refractory to remediation. A possible explanation to this discrepancy could lie in the way in which prob- lem solving/clinical reasoning skills are taught at an undergraduate level of training. Traditional ap- proaches to teaching clinical skills are often based on the assumption that clinical reasoning is a skill, divorced from content knowledge. Although clini- cal reasoning skills and clinical knowledge could be developed and delivered separately, there is support for an integrated approach to improve the organisa- tion and structure of relevant clinical knowledge and practices (Barrows and Pickell 1991)."}

Many of these situations can be characterised by complexity, ambi- guity, doubt and uniqueness. With this known entity, it may be better to conceptualise the skills required for professional practice and competency, in terms of smart action, as opposed to clinical reasoning. Differentiating the two at this level allows for a cen- tred approach in dealing with judgment and decision making within a speciﬁc context and time. In other words smart action implies making the best deci- sion under a given set of circumstances. It does not, however, mean always taking the right action. Smart action skills are often the catalyst for reﬂective anal- ysis of performance. The evolution of this process provides the basis for professional development and critical awareness in decision making. An important aspect of the development of higher cognitive skills and clinical reasoning ability is the ability to construct and use knowledge.

The majority of available re- search on clinical reasoning concludes that three pro- cesses interact in order to bring about good quality clinical reasoning (Higgs and Jones 2000; Higgs and Titchen 2001). These three processes are knowledge, cognition and metacognition. These three interact throughout the process of receiving, interpreting, processing and utilising clinical information during decision mak- ing, clinical intervention and reﬂection on actions and outcomes.

This ability to have and be able to recall task spe- ciﬁc knowledge is one of the elements that marks out an experienced practitioner from a novice one. They are able to bring together many key elements of knowledge; anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, pathology, etc.and link them together to provide a rational explanation of the problem with which they are presented. This is often coupled with their prac- tice experience (knowing how to do things), which then allows for a superior management of the patient. This use of knowledge is very much coupled to the process of reﬂection and this is covered in the next section. Cognition and metacognition Cognition is the act of thinking, with metacognition being the awareness and monitoring of cognition; that is, thinking about thinking. These two elements are integrated into clinical reasoning through the process of reﬂection."}

Reﬂection itself involves two different aspects, one is reﬂection in action and the other is reﬂection about action. Reﬂection in action involves thinking about what you are doing, for example, whilst carrying out Lachman’s test at the knee, the practitioner should be reﬂecting on, “is this what I expected to ﬁnd?If it isn’t, why isn’t it?”Reﬂection about action, is essentially thinking about what has happened after it has happened, questions such as, “what was good about what I did?What was bad?What can I improve for next time?What do I need to take away from the experience and store to use again?”Reﬂection is the key to information processing in clinical reasoning. From a strong knowledge base, patterns can be identiﬁed; by reﬂecting in action the strength of the patterns relationship to the presenting problem can be tested."}

There are a number of potential categories that this hypothesis can ﬁt into, including: source of symptoms; mechanism of symptoms; con- tributing factors; precautions and contraindications; management and treatment; and ﬁnally prognosis. The source of symptoms can be considered by using a component model (Figure 16.3). As can be seen from Figure 16.3 the source of symptoms can either be local to the site of pain or remote from the site of pain, but capable of referring pain to the area of the pain. The mechanism of symptoms is what has caused the pain, this could be from an ex- trinsic source such as a kick or fall, it also could be from an intrinsic source such as with overuse in- juries, were the tissues become overloaded and break down. The contributing factors are those factors that predispose the patient to the mechanism of injury occurring, they could include poor proprioception, muscle imbalances, shortened soft tissue structures or even lack of ﬁtness and skill. The precautions and contra-indications are those factors that might limit any chosen course of action because of potential harm to the patient."}

In summary, open mindedness, the questioning of existing beliefs and reﬂective thinking are essential for good clinical reasoning to work. Example Using the example in Figure 16.3 it can be seen that the potential sources of the symptom of posterior thigh pain are multiple. If we take the simplest option in terms of differential diagnosis such as a strain of hamstring muscles as the injury, the ﬁrst thing we need to do is discount the other sources of symptoms. For example, in order to discount the lumbar spine, sacroiliac and hip joints, these joints must have full pain-free range of movement, the spinal and peripheral nerves must on tensile loading show no mechano-sensitivity, and the other muscles must have full range of movement and no pain on contraction. The hamstring muscle group shows pain on contraction and elongation (stretch) along with pain on palpation. The typical mechanism of injury for hamstring injury is one of a sudden onset of pain during an eccentric contraction to decelerate knee extension during swing phase whilst sprinting, if any other mechanism occurred then this must be clariﬁed to make sure it ﬁts with one which would result in hamstring muscle injury. There are a number of factors that can contribute to the occurrence of an hamstring muscle injury, one is previous history of hamstring injury, another is age; older athletes are more likely to have an hamstring strain. Further contributory factors are strength imbalances between the quadriceps and hamstrings, altered mechano-sensitivity of the sciatic nerve and degenerative change in the lumbar spine. Assuming there are no contra-indications and pre- cautions to treatment, the management and treatment can be planned."}
{"id": "1676", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The treatment needs to be directed not only at the local cause of symptoms; the ham- strings in this case (though remote causes may have to be dealt with in other cases) but also at the pre- disposing factors to prevent any reoccurrence. So the strength of the tissue (its tolerance to load) will need to be gradually increased along with its toler- ance to elongation, in doing this its ability to toler- ate eccentric load will need special attention and be brought to a level in balance with quadriceps concen- tric strength. Simultaneously, mobility of the sciatic nerve and lumbar spine must be maintained to reduce the inﬂuence of these factors on any future injury. To conceptualise the clinical decisions considered within the above example, it may be useful to use the 6D approach depicted in Figure 16.2. The example considers posterior thigh pain from a multiple of perspectives and encourages a fusion of thought and argument to best decide on effective management. Using the 6D approach, the clinician ﬁrstly needs to dissect knowledge on posterior thigh pain aetiology and consider the numerous sources of the pain. This component will draw on anatomical landscapes of the posterior thigh region. The next phase will drive the clinician to consider which information sets are most useful in digesting the issues confronting the cause of the pain. Once considered, a process of discerning information, in this case, consider- ation of the hamstring mechanism of action and functionality may be most important clinically, to develop an appropriate treatment and management plan for the pain. These decisions, drawn from a sequential analysis of knowledge and anatomical architecture, allow the clinician to cross a threshold into a different and often new way of thinking about the presenting issues and problems."}
{"id": "1677", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "This threshold crossing may be transformative and irreversible and the clinician may now be forced to live with the deci- sions made and actions taken. The later phase of the 6D approach, teases out how the clinician chooses to defend the actions based on the knowledge organisation from the presenting issue. In summary, the example presented above can be divided into two important clinical reasoning processes. The ﬁrst is understanding the issue or problem and using prior learning or experiential knowledge to develop a plan of action and treatment. The second involves the cognitive processes of higher order reasoning to defend and justify clinically the decisions made and actions taken. The entire process is fuelled by an evaluation of the outcome. The model in Figure 16.4, used extensively in action research and developed by Susman (1983), is useful in providing an alternatively analysis and conceptual map for the example on posterior thigh pain. The model depicts a progress process-driven approach in helping the clinician organise thinking into a practice and management plan for action.

The role of reha- bilitation is covered with analysis of the function of commonly utilised exercise and the role of clinical reasoning in determining the diagnosis and formu- lating a safe and effective rehabilitation programme. Incidence of shoulder injury The glenohumeral joint is one of the most frequently injured areas of the upper extremity in competitive sports. Studies indicate that 8–20% of athletic in- juries involve the glenohumeral joint (Hill 1983; Lo et al.1990; Hutson 1996; Terry and Chopp 2000; Ranson and Gregory 2008). Athletes whose sports require a large amount of time with their arms above the level of the shoulder, such as those playing racquet sports, sports involv- ing throwing (baseball, cricket, American Football and water polo), swimmers and rugby players (due to their arm position within the tackle) commonly report a high incidence of shoulder pain with up to 43.8% reporting shoulder pain (Lo et al.1990). Hutson (1996) reported that more than 40% of elite swimmers complained of shoulder pain at some point during their careers, and this was related to the fact that 90% of the propulsive force comes from the upper extremity (Counsilman 1977) with the main cause of pain being attributed to glenohumeral joint instability (Weldon and Richardson 2001), due to signiﬁcantly increased humeral head translation (Tibone et al.2002)."}

As there is little bony contact between the head of the humerus and the glenoid fossa of the scapula, there is a great range of mobility at the joint with an inherent instability of the articulation (Armﬁeld et al.2003). Joint homeostasis is maintained by the harmonious static and dynamic interaction of the muscles, liga- ments and joint capsule. The static stabilisers (Table 17.1) of the joint consist of the labrum, capsule and ligaments, and the dynamic stabilisers of the joint (Table 17.2) are the muscles of the rotator cuff, del- toid and scapular stabilisers (Terry and Chopp 2000; Woodward and Best 2000)."}

Assessment of injury risk The assessment of posture within the domain of in- jury rehabilitation has traditionally been performed via visual observation of speciﬁc joints/bony land- marks, and the corresponding position they have to one another. Good posture has been described as a state of muscular and skeletal balance that protects the supporting structures of the body against injury or progressive deformity, irrespective of the atti- tudes in which the structures are resting or working (Kendall et al.1993). Ideal alignment standards used in clinical practice have previously been highlighted (Kendall et al.1993; Sahrmann 2002). The widely accepted description of normal standing posture is that proposed by Kendall and McCreary (1983) as a vertical line passing through the lobe of the ear, the seventh cervical vertebra, acromion process, greater trochanter and slightly anterior to the midlines of the knee and lateral malleolus. Deviations outside this theoretical plumb-line have been described as abnor- mal, and have been linked to numerous problems. Posture deviations frequently found in the cervical and thoracic spine have been suggested to affect the normal function of the glenohumeral joint (Ayub 1991; Kendall et al.1993; Einhorn et al."}

Standing postures associated with a forward head are seen in association with combinations of in- creased lordosis in the cervical and lumbar regions, an increased kyphosis in the thoracic region, pro- tracted shoulders (with elevation or depression) and abnormal scapula position (Ayub 1991; Greenﬁeld et al.1995; Grimsby and Gray 1997; McDonnell and Sahrmann 2002; Sahrmann 2002; McDonnell et al.2005) (Figure 17.1), although not all studies have found this (Raine and Twomey 1997; Hanten et al.2000). Several authors have suggested that muscle imbalances and shortening can occur in the sternocleidomastoid, upper trapezius and levator scapula with a forward head position. This will lead to elevated and abducted scapula, and increased tho- racic kyphosis, increasing the risk of impingement (Ayub 1991; Grimsby and Gray 1997). Subjects with increased thoracic kyphosis have been shown to predispose altered scapular kinematics; when Figure 17.1 Posture.asymptomatic subjects were positioned in a slouched posture when sitting and instructed to elevate their arm, there was a signiﬁcant reduction in posterior tilt and upward rotation of the scapula, as well as an increase in the amount of scapular elevation and in- ternal rotation (Kebaetse et al."}
{"id": "1698", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "1999). When subjects who were experiencing sub acromial impingement improved their posture, it was not found to have a signiﬁcant effect on the intensity of the pain, but increased the range of shoulder elevation before the pain was experienced (Lewis et al.2005a). Thus thoracic posture needs to be optimised in patients with impingement-like symptoms, during all daily activities, and exercises directed at improving tho- racic extension should be considered. Interventions to consider are, amongst others, thoracic spine joint mobilisation (Bang and Deyle 2000), corrective taping of the scapular and thoracic spine (Lewis et al.2005b), facilitation scapulothoracic musculature (Konrad et al.2006), and facilitate the activity of the rotator cuff (Magarey and Jones 2003)."}
{"id": "1699", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "314 SHOULDER INJURIES IN SPORT Shoulder girdle, scapular and glenohumeral joint position The role of the scapula is extremely important in pro- viding a stable base from which the glenohumeral joint functions, as well as determining the overall position of the shoulder girdle (Kibler 1991; Paine and Voight 1993; Kibler 1998; Sahrmann 2002; Magarey and Jones 2003). The efﬁciency of muscu- lar activity is dependent on the position of the scapula and the length-tension relationships of the scapu- lar stabilisers and rotator cuff muscles, which orig- inate on the scapula, cervical and/or thoracic spine (Einhorn et al.1997; Mottram 1997; Magarey and Jones 2003). The scapula stabilisers, such as trapez- ius and serratus anterior, can be adversely affected by common abnormal postures, such as increased thoracic kyphosis and forward head positions (Greenﬁeld et al.1995; Ludewig and Cook 2000; Borstad and Ludewig 2005; Lewis et al.2005a;). Certain muscle imbalances, particularly shortening, can occur in the sternocleidomastoid, upper trapez- ius and levator scapula with a forward head position, leading to increased thoracic kyphosis, and ele- vated or depressed, abducted scapula (Ayub 1991; Grimsby and Gray 1997). This increased thoracic kyphosis causes the scapular to become abducted due to lengthening of the rhomboid and lower trapez- ius muscles, whilst shortening the serratus anterior, latissimus dorsi, subscapularis, teres major and pec- toralis major and minor muscles, and pulling the humerus into an anterior and/or internally rotated po- sition, and further anteriorly tilting the scapula (Ayub 1991; Borstad and Ludewig 2005). This posture al- ters the scapulohumeral rhythm and perpetuates vari- ous forms of impingements, either in the subacromial space or inter-articular, during arm elevation, as the ability of the scapula to tilt posteriorly is inhibited by overactive pectoralis minor (Lewis et al.2005a)."}

The examiner stabilises the scapula with one arm whilst the other grasps the humeral head and translates it in an anterome- dial direction on the glenoid. Unilateral increases in humeral head translation of the symptomatic shoul- der indicate anterior glenohumeral joint instability. Apprehension test (Jobe et al.1989) This is performed with the humerus in 90 degrees of abduction, 90 degrees of elbow ﬂexion and external rotation of the shoulder.

These factors need to be identiﬁed and address along with the restoration of neuromuscular control. The rehabilitation will require that the individual’s motor skills are trained back to pre-injury levels. Dynamic stability of the glenohumeral joint is aided by the sensorimotor system, due to the presence of mechanoreceptors within the joint which inﬂuence the patterns of muscle recruitment, reﬂex activity and joint stiffness. Without correct sensorimotor control there will be increased translation between the humeral head and glenoid, resulting in plastic deformation and laxity of the joint capsule, de- creased rotator cuff facilitation and alterations in muscle sequencing and timing (Ogston and Ludewig 2007). Ultimately, the management of the injured shoul- der complex is a challenge that can be made easier if based on a thorough and exact clinical examination of the whole patient.

Integrated scapulothoracic rehabilitation Table 17.6 is a very useful tool which can be utilised with any shoulder injury. In all cases, whether treatment involves surgical intervention or not, alterations in faulty posture can be addressed, and rehabilitation of other parts of the kinetic chain – trunk and pelvic girdle – can commence at a relatively high level. Once again, consideration of the kinetic chain links and myofascial slings will lead the therapist to areas distal to the shoulder girdle which will require soft tissue work in order to elongate shortened tissues. More local tissue work will need to be carried out under the advisement of the surgeon following surgical intervention, so that newly repaired tissues are not placed under excessive strain at too early a stage. Ranges of movement for the exercises can be mod- iﬁed for the speciﬁcs of the patient, ensuring that the quality of the movement is correct from the outset, and that early substitution patterns are identiﬁed and correct, and that movement is ﬂuent and pain free. Once again surgical intervention may require a little more lateral thinking in order to carry out speciﬁc exercises effectively and safely. When rehabilitating a shoulder that has received surgical intervention, it is imperative that the ther- apist converses with the surgeon and understands what technique has been carried out, what type of ﬁxation was used, what state the repaired tissue was in at the repair, and what tissues have been repaired. The surgeon and therapist can then formulate a patient-speciﬁc, injury-speciﬁc rehabilitation protocol, based on information such as at what ranges of movement during the surgery was the repaired tissue put on tension?This information can then be utilised as a guide for the protected range of movement during the early stages of rehabilitation."}

This can be utilised to expedite recovery knowing that some exercises place more or less stress on certain muscles than others."}

This pain was lo- cated over the antero-superior aspect of his gleno- humeral joint, and increased in intensity with contin- ued overhead activity. He stated that he had recently increased the amount of overhead activity during his coaching sessions, as he was working to improve some of his pupils’ service action. Apart from this he stated that he had not changed anything else con- cerned with his training. He stated that his health was good and that he was not taking any medication, and that he had not changed his racquet, or string tension recently. Observation was taken from the front, back and side of the patient with the patient stripped down to the waist. Figure 17.1 illustrates a posture which de- viates from the stated “ideal”; the left proﬁle shows a forward head posture, and increased thoracic kypho- sis, protracted shoulder girdle and anterior humeral head. He has an anterior tilted pelvis and sway back posture. Active movements produced left shoulder pain on abduction at 100 degrees (Figure 17.19) and ﬂex- ion at 120 degrees (Figure 17.20), which increased as elevation continued, and eased at the end of the available active range. Abduction demonstrated in- creased activity in the left upper Trapezius."}

Posterior pelvic tilting in crook lying was commenced to facilitate inner range holds of rectus abdominus and gluteus maximus, and lengthen the lumbar multiﬁdus and interspinous ligaments. Lower limb functional deﬁcits were addressed with inner range gluteus medius holds, in side lying, and hip extension holds in prone lying. In addition to this functional movement patterns were commenced involving multiplanar movements executed with cor- rect lower limb alignment. The athlete ceased overhead activity, but was al- lowed to continue coaching ground strokes, until he had a full pain-free range of active ﬂexion and abduction. Electromyographic feedback and video recording were used to reinforce the correct move- ment patterns. Closed kinetic chain exercises were utilised early on within the rehabilitation programme to facilitate rotator cuff co-activation, and postural taping was commenced at the outset to aid with pro- prioceptive awareness. This athlete complied well with the rehabilitation programme, and was able to return to full tennis- related activities within one month, with the proviso that he further progress his rehabilitation, and in- clude regular stretching exercises, and lower limb conditioning as a regular part of his training. This case demonstrates the multi-factorial nature of shoulder dysfunction. The skill of the clinician is to identify relevant clinical ﬁndings that require addressing in order to establish a long-term recovery."}

The chapter will further detail acute management strategies of common elbow injuries and principles of rehabilita- tion through to return to sport. The use of appropriate exercises using single or multiple joints as opposed to the conceptually ﬂawed concept of “open” and “closed” kinetic chains will be considered and debated. An “open kinetic chain” exists when the foot or hand is not in contact with the ground or supporting surface. In a “closed kinetic chain”, the foot or hand is weight-bearing and is therefore in contact with the ground or supporting surface To further illustrate the management of these mus- culoskeletal injuries of the elbow, a case study will be used to highlight key assessment, treatment and reha- bilitation strategies. This chapter draws together and analyses common approaches to treatment within an evidence-based framework. Common elbow injuries/conditions To fully appreciate the scope of injuries and patholo- gies common to the elbow joint, one needs to con- sider how the elbow functions in relation to upper limb kinematics. This chapter will focus on the in- juries listed in Table 18.1 and will further provide guidelines on injury management techniques for a range of acute and overuse injuries to both the elbow and forearm. A systematic analysis will be detailed through assessment and treatment of these injuries, which then informs the nature of the rehabilitation. Principles of assessment Assessment relies on a good applied knowledge of anatomy; a systematic and applied approach to the assessment process."}

The approach taken by Society of Orthopaedic Medicine (SOM), which is based on the work of the late Dr James Cyriax is a good basic assessment approach. Additional tests can be added in as relevant to enhance clinical reasoning If there has been a fall, there may well be an obvi- ous visible distortion of the bones/joint following an injury, which may well indicate either a fracture or dislocation. Likewise there may be bruising evident or redness indicating inﬂammation.

The elbow is not an “emotional” joint, i.e. the reported signs and symptoms are normally speciﬁc and can be localised easily by the client. Unlike the cervical spine or shoulder that may have a more complex subjective history. Normal active movement of the elbow joint is: r elbow ﬂexion: 0–150 degrees r elbow extension: 0–10 degrees of hyperextension (Loudon 2008) Passive movements test the inert structures, e.g. joint capsules and ligaments. Passive movements test pain, range and “end-feel”. There are three normal “end-feels” to passive movement testing: r hard (bone to bone as in end of range elbow extension) r soft (approximation of soft tissue as in end of range elbow ﬂexion) r elastic (it is the “elastic” resistance felt at end of range as in full elevation of the shoulder) Resisted movement tests are used in order to test the contractile structures e.g. muscle, tendon. This is the minimum that would be appropriate depending on the experience and the clinical reasoning of the clinician. The possible responses to resisted muscle testing are: Normal response strong and painfree Contractile lesion strong and painful Neurological weakness weak but painfree Partial rupture (or suspected more serious pathology, e.g. fracture or tumour) weak and painful Claudication/provocation of an overuseinjury painful on repetition Psychological component/serious pathology “juddering”/exaggerated response the client to focus on giving accurate feedback to the rehabilitator.

The combined pressure and ﬂexion test was performed by placing the subject’s elbow in maximum ﬂexion and whilst in this position pressure was placed on the ulnar nerve just proximal to the cu- bital tunnel. Subject symptom response was recorded at both 30 and 60 seconds. The clinical provocative evaluation techniques have been extrapolated to the cubital tunnel syndrome, although statistical veriﬁ- cation of these tests is lacking (Buehler and Thayer 1988; Rayan 1992; Rayan, Jenson and Duke 1992).

This would normally decrease the pain and increase the range of move- ment. The increase in range should be followed up with exercise in the pain free range of movement. Tendon ruptures Acute avulsions of triceps or biceps are rare. Triceps tends to be affected more commonly with excessive deceleration force as in a fall. Biceps tendon is more associated with weight lifting activities. Acute rup- tures of either require surgical repair. Pulled elbow This occurs quite frequently in the under 5s (often accompanied by a guilty and upset parent) as the most common mechanism is when a parent snatches the hand of a child misbehaving at the edge of a pavement, or when parents “swing” their child in play between them. Pitching in baseball, serving in tennis, spiking in volleyball, passing in American football and launching in javelin throwing can all produce elbow pathology by forceful valgus stress (usually during high velocity eccentric loading dur- ing the terminal deceleration of the limb), with me- dial stretching, lateral compression and posterior im- pingement."}

Delineating injury patterns to the elbow in children can be challenging, given the cartilaginous composi- tion of the distal humerus and the multiple secondary ossiﬁcation centres that appear and unite with the epiphysis at deﬁned ages (Magra et al.2007). The joint at such a young age is lax. It is prone to recurrent injury if the annular ligament is subjected to repeated over-stretching (Illingworth 1975). The radial head easily slides from beneath the orbicular ligament, the child immediately complains of pain and there is a noticeable limit of supination. There is normally a spontaneous recovery if the arm is rested in a sling for 48 hours. It may be reduced by forced supination while pushing the radius in a proximal direction, by forced radial deviation of the hand (McRae 2003; Kesson and Atkins 2005). In children and adolescents, the epiphyseal plate is weaker than the surrounding ligaments, predisposing them to epiphyseal plate injuries. On the other hand, post-pubescent or skeletally mature athletes are more prone to tendinous or ligamentous injury."}

Unstable/displaced fractures should be promptly referred for surgical orthopaedic in- tervention. However, when the articular or cortical surface has less than 2mm of vertical or horizontal displacement, the fracture may be regarded as sta- ble and as such treated conservatively (Shapiro and Wang 1995). Over vigorous rehabilitation can be an issue with the elbow. Remember, safety of the client is paramount, “ﬁrst do no harm!”A clear understand- ing of the applied anatomy and appropriate appli- cation of graded rehabilitation should result in there being no problem. Awareness and caution is essential in the musculoskeletal management of the elbow. It is therefore essential that the clinician has an aware- ness of myositis ossiﬁcans, which is a condition that may occur after supracondylar fractures and dislo- cations of the elbow.

The most common mechanism of injury is in contact sports. Impairment of the vascular supply to the forearm is a major complication. The assessment of pulses distal to the dislocation is essential. Urgent reduction of the dislocation is required if pulses are absent. Re- duction is normally relatively easy to do if it is done quickly before the onset of protective muscle spasm. The elbow is held in 45 degrees of ﬂexion, the clini- cian applies longitudinal traction by applying a ﬁrm grip to the anterior aspect of the humerus.

The risk of complications during treatment was generally low in most patients, and the majority healed their fractures uneventfully.

They are classiﬁed into types 1–4 and the mechanism is normally from a fall on an outstretched hand. Type 1 are “non” or minimally displaced. They respond to early aspiration, splinting (removable) active grade “A” (pain-free) mobilisation and normally are healed in 6–8 weeks.

Fracture of the radius and ulna The mechanism of injury to the forearm bones is a fall on an outstretched hand It is usually clinically obvious. X-rays should be taken for a post reduction comparison. Two types of dislocation occur: the Monteggia injury, which is a fractured ulna with dislocated head of the radius at the elbow joint, and the Galeazzi injury, which is a fractured radius with dislocated head of the ulna at the wrist joint. In the adult, perfect reduction by an orthopaedic surgeon for internal ﬁxation of the radial and ulnar fracture is required in order to return to sport.

The favoured position for immobilisation is in pronation, although in proximal radial fractures and also in Smith’s fractures at the wrist, the forearm should extend above the elbow and leave the metacarpophalangeal joints free. Stress fracture Stress fractures are a result of overload, overtrain- ing or insufﬁcient rest. Brukner et al.

When it is clinically indicated the mobilisa- tion with movement (MWM) for tennis elbow as described by Mulligan (1999) is a simple but ef- fective means of treating this condition. However, an indication for use is determined by trial applica- tion of the technique. The reasons for selection of a MWM for treatment were: r immediate abolishment of pain during the trial/testing r previous experience and knowledge of efﬁcacy of the technique r potential for integration into a home management programme. (Mulligan 1999) Struijs et al. (2001) conducted a systematic review of orthotic devices for tennis elbow. This study was done in Amsterdam as 21% of clients with lateral epicondylitis were prescribed an orthotic device as a treatment strategy (Verhaar 1992).

Better designed and well conducted RCTs of sufﬁ- cient power are warranted. The pathological process is a degeneration of the ECRB tendon at the extensor origin of the lateral epi- condyle. The mechanism of injury is multi-factorial. The key contributing factors being: “overuse”; a heavy racquet or too small grip; a recent change of racquet or too tight a grip between shots; muscle imbalance and loss of ﬂexibility; poor blood supply of the 1–2 cm of the distal attachment of ECRB; and repeated excessive loading leading to degenerative changes in the tendon. If there is continued use there will be microscopic tearing and scarring within the tendon (Regan et al.1992). This is a mechanical pro- cess primarily and as such it should be described as a tendonosis (Nirshel 1992) or tendinopathy rather than tendonitis."}

Hutson, M. A. (1990). Posterior impingement of the olecranon fossa, val- gus stress to the medial structures of the elbow joint and compression injuries to the radiohumeral joint are all linked to repeated high velocity throwing, for example shot putting (Figure 18.13). Often with throwing there is a forced hyper ex- tension at the elbow which produces a shearing force between the olecranon and olecranon fossa, hence the blanket term “ throwers elbow” which may give rise to elbow problems (Hutson, 1990). Initially there is soft tissue hypertrophy but if it is not ad- dressed then osteophytes can form on the tip of the olecranon and within the fossa particularly in the supracondylar ridge area. From a prevention perspective it is essential that the athlete’s training technique is observed and their training schedule is discussed with both the athlete and coach in order to deploy the appropriate problem-solving approach to the management of this closely related range of conditions, which all have similar reported signs and symptoms. It may be that oseophytes appear due to over-use or there may be a stress fracture caused by the athlete having poor eccentric strength of the antagonistic muscle group. This would result in an inability to effectively decel- erate once the object is released, therefore eccentric training of the antagonistic muscles is essential. The rehabilitator should keep an open mind, review and monitor intervention in order to clinically problem solve and utilise the most effective strategy for mus- culoskeletal management. It is often difﬁcult to differentiate between ex- tensor tendinopathy and early stages of PIN entrap- ment."}

As with any peripheral nerve involvement one would expect pain and parasthesia. Signs and symp- toms that would indicate PIN entrapement may in- clude: r pain over the forearm extensor muscle group r parasthesia of the hand and lateral aspect of the forearm r aching of the wrist r pain in the middle and/or upper third of the humerus r maximum tenderness is reported over the supina- tor muscle (four ﬁngers breadth distal to the lateral epicondyle).

This is normally successful; however, decompression may be required in stubborn, resistant cases and this has a good success rate (Lutz 1991). The key here is good differential diagnosis and early appropriate interven- tion as tendinopathy responds well to rehabilitation. However, if posterior impingement is not diagnosed early it is common for athletes to have a ﬁxed ﬂexion deformity and report pain at end-of-range extension.

There is often a visible swelling, a reduced range of movement and pain on palpation of the bursa (Loudon et al.2008).

One of the biggest errors in man- agement is trying to progress too quickly in the exercise programme and hastily returning to sport rather than monitoring and managing the process, which should be individualised but following clear principles.

The common mechanism is throw- ers who “open up to early”; that is, they become front on at too early a stage in the throwing action. This results in inﬂammation of the ligament, which pro- gresses to scarring, then calciﬁcation and very occa- sionally to ligament rupture. On assessment there is often a mild degree of instability on a valgus stress test. The client reports a localised tenderness over the ligament on palpation.

Some research studies have shown that massage techniques have a signiﬁcant impact on the reduction of that exces- sive neuromuscular stimulation (Morelli et al.1991; Sullivan et al.1991; Braverman and Schulman 1999). A range of conservative treatment modali- ties are often utilised in order to address excessive muscular tension and of those treatment selections. Liebenson (1989) found massage to be one of the most effective in achieving a reduction in muscle tension.

The increase in range of movement that is achieved should be followed up with exercise in the pain-free range of movement. The analgesic effect of massage has been well documented (Field 2000; Yates 2004). Pain is a multi-factorial and complex phenomenon; the mechanisms for reducing pain using massage are also varied. Mechanisms include: muscle relaxation, improved circulation, deactivation of trigger points, the release of endorphins and serotonin, the pain gate theory and the promotion of restful sleep (Benjamin and Lamp 2005)"}

If it is noted on X-ray that loose bodies are evident they should be removed to reduce future re-occurrences of locking and also to reduce the risk of causing further damage to the articular surface of the elbow joint. Elbow replace- ments are relatively rare. Acute treatment Cryotherapy Ice or cold treatment is often termed cryotherapy. Cold is the initial treatment of choice for virtually all acute conditions involving injuries to the mus- culoskeletal system (Cox 1993). This may take the form of cold packs, ice towels, cold baths or ice massage (Kitchen 2004). It can be used to control acute inﬂammation and thereby accelerate recovery from injury or trauma. Due to the low thermal con- ductivity of underlying subcutataneous fat tissues, applications of cryotherapy for short periods are in- effective in the cooling of deeper tissues. For this reason longer treatments of 20–30 minutes are rec- ommended."}

Ice should be applied to the injured area until signs and symptoms of inﬂammation have gone. Ice should be used for at least 72 hours after an acute injury, (Calabrese and Rooney 1986; Cox 1993). Grifﬁn (1997) suggests that re-warming begins about 20 seconds after the preceding application, and that sta- tistically signiﬁcant (p < 0.05) decreases in temper- ature can be produced with repeated applications of cryotherapy. It is recommended that ice be applied following an injury and throughout the inﬂammatory phase (ACPSM 1999). Cold applied to an acute injury will lower metabolism in the injured area and as a result lower the tissue demands for oxygen, thus reducing hy- poxia. This beneﬁt extends to uninjured tissue, pre- venting tissue death from spreading to adjacent nor- mal cellular structures. Cold may be used in order to reduce the reﬂex muscle guarding and spastic con- ditions that accompany pain. Its pain relieving ef- fects is probably one of its greatest clinical beneﬁts (Prentice 2004). With ice treatment applied for 20–30 minutes the athlete may report an uncomfortable feeling of cold, followed by a “burning” sensation, an aching and ﬁnally complete numbness (Calabres 1986; Cox 1993)."}

It must be taken into consideration that often cooling is not done in isolation in an acute injury, it is often accompanied by compression, which means from a research and evidence base perspective it is difﬁcult to state that the beneﬁts are due to cooling alone. The cold treatment may lead to a reduction in bleeding which may be due to a resultant reduction in blood ﬂow and is more likely to occur during the early phase of treatment. Sauls (1999) examined the ev- idence for the efﬁcacy of cooling by undertaking a review of the effects of cold for pain relief; beneﬁts were noted for certain orthopaedic procedures and for injections in adults. Ultrasound Ultrasound should be applied in a pulsed mode at a low intensity during the acute phase of inﬂammation to minimise the risk of aggravating the condition and to accelerate recovery. The mast cells release histamine, which is one of the key chemicals to modify the wound after injury. Research has shown that a single treatment using therapeutic ultrasound in the early acute stage of the healing process can stimulate mast cells to degranu- late and to release histamine into the surrounding tis- sues (Fyfe and Chahl 1982; Hamilton 1986). It is hy- pothesised that one of the effects of ultrasound is to stimulate the mast cell to degranulate by increasing the mast cell’s permeability to calcium. Mast cells are one of the wound factors they have a key role in that they orchestrate the early repair sequences (Clark 1990)."}

Young and Dyson (1990) found that using ultra- sound at an intensity of 0.5W/cm2 and a frequency of 3.0 MHz appeared the most effective setting on the stimulation of ﬁbroblast (“building-block”) pop- ulation growth. For many years therapeutic ultrasound was mis- takenly thought of an anti-inﬂammatory modality in the rehabilitator’s “tool kit” (Reid 1981; Snow and Johnson 1988). It is easy to see why there was this error in clinical reasoning, as often a rapid resolution of oedema was noted after using ultrasound (El Hag et al.1985). It is unfortunate that the evidence to en- lighten our reasoning on this was available from as early as 1978 by Hustler, Zarod and Williams. At that time “evidence-based practice” was not part of the undergraduate programme in the way it is embedded into current practice. Goddard et al. (1983) identiﬁed in their research that ultrasound encourages oedema formation to occur more quickly and to accelerate the inﬂammatory phase, therefore accelerating the wound into the proliferative stage of healing more effectively and efﬁciently than “sham” irradiated ul- trasound groups. A few years later, similar ﬁndings were reported by Fyfe and Chahl (1985)."}

Also the dosages used in the studies varied considerably often for no discernable reason. This was further complicated when more than one electrotherapy modality was used (Herrera-Lasso and Fernandez Dominguez 1993; Nussbaum et al.1994; van der Heijden et al.1999). Surveys on the use of therapeu- tic physical agents in rehabilitation in USA, Canada, England, Australia and the Netherlands have all con- cluded that ultrasound therapy is by far the most widely used physical agent currently available to clinicians (Robinson and Snyder-Mackler 1988; ter Harr et al.1988; Lindsey et al.1990, 1995; Robert- son and Spurritt 1998; Roebroeck et al.1998)."}

Note: ultrasound is not a pain mod- ulation therapy, but can be used clinically, depending on desired effect, to assist with the management of inﬂammation and initial healing. Corticosteroids An alternative intervention to therapeutic ultrasound would be the use of a corticosteroid injection. The suggested guide for a dose by the Society of Ortho- peadic Medicine is a dosage of approx 10mg total volume, in a mixture of triamcinalone acetonide (in a small, 0.25 ml, concentrated dose of KENALOG or an equivalent mixed with 0.75 ml of local anaes- thetic), which aims to reduce the inﬂammation. Good results have been shown in the short term by several different research groups (Price et al.1991; Haker and Lundeberg 1993; Assendelft et al.1996; Verhaar et al.1996; Hay et al.1999)."}

There is currently a move to increasing doses in some areas (particularly in the shoulder), however Price et al. (1991) found that an increased volume injection of 20 mg of triamcinalone produced similar clinical results to 10mg and the higher dosage was much more likely to produce skin atrophy. Skin atrophy is a side effect of injection. How- ever, the more signiﬁcant but very rare complication of injection is anaphylaxis, which is described as a rapid and often unanticipated, life-threatening syn- drome.

Grade A (pain-free) mobilisation A grade A mobilisation is an active, passive or ac- tive/assisted movement performed within the client’s pain-free range of movement.

Exercise should be appropriate to the stage of heal- ing and of the appropriate grade and type. It is common practice to classify exercises as “closed” or “open” chains. An open chain exists when the hand is not in contact with the ground so the distal segment is mobile and is not ﬁxed (Hill- man 1994; Prentice 2004). In a closed chain the hand is weight-bearing, so the distal segment is ﬁxed or stabilised. The literature shows a clear trend to support the fact that “closed” chains should precede any progres- sion to “open” chains but most of the research has been conducted using the lower limb (Cohen 2001). In the elbow, closed chain exercises should be used in order to improve the dynamic stability of the more proximal muscles surrounding the elbow in sports where the elbow is required to provide more proxi- mal stability. Open chain exercises for strengthening ﬂexion, extension, pronation and supination are es- sential to regain high-velocity dynamic movements of the elbow that are required in sports requiring throwing type activities (Prentice 2004). There are advantages and disadvantages to both open and closed exercise. Fowler (2008, p18), sets out an argument in his paper that “this classiﬁcation is ﬂawed and the rationale for it questioned”."}

It is more appropriate that the clinician utilises their skills of applied anatomy and clinically reasons to decide on the most appropriate exercise and to review its effects than to become too focused on pedantic points of terminology to the detriment of applied clinical practice. The Society of Orthopaedic Medicine uses grades: A, B and C. Grade A, would be deﬁned as a pain-free, ac- tive, passive or resisted exercise. Grade B is a mobilisation performed at the end of available range. It is a speciﬁc, cyclical, sustained stretching tech- nique in the plastic range. The aim is to cause per- manent elongation of connective tissue. Grade C (for example the mills manipulation) is a manipulative technique. It is a passive technique performed at the end of available range. It is a minimal amplitude high-velocity thrust (Kesson and Atkins 2005)."}

It is essential that a thorough working knowledge of applied anatomy and the principles of biomechanics are appreciated in order to iden- tify existing and potential adaptive or compensatory movements (Kirkendall et al.2001). Understanding of the relationship of the healing process to exercise intensity Progression or adaptation of a rehabilitation pro- gramme should be based on stages of healing of the injury. Exercise that is too “high demand” in terms of time or intensity is likely to be detrimental to progress. It is helpful to be aware of signs that the intensity of exercises being used in the programme are exces- sive for the stage of healing. Signs to look out for are: r increase in the pain a client reports r loss of range of movement r plateau in progress r increase in the laxity of a healing ligament.

She should main- tain active movement in the pain-free range. Mills manipulation This is performed following preparation by trans- verse friction massage (until analgesia is reached). The Mills manipulation is performed only if the source of the tennis elbow is at the teno-osseous site and if the patient has got full range extension of the elbow. The reason for this is that if full ex- tension is available the manipulation force will fall on the adhesions and improve the range of move- ment and reduce pain. However, if full elbow ex- tension is not available then the manipulation force would fall onto the elbow joint and potentially cause a traumatic arthritis. It is essential that the site of the problem is accurately located as it would be inappro- priate for the Mills manipulation to be performed to treat symptoms at the other three sites. It is strongly advised that a Society of Orthopaedic Medicine Course is attended for training under supervision be- fore adding this treatment option to your therapeutic “toolkit”."}

Ice/cryotherapy or therapeutic ultrasound Ice treatment is useful in the acute phase or indeed in acute exacerbation of a chronic elbow, which is common in tennis elbow. However, ice should be discontinued when acute inﬂammation has resolved to avoid slowing chemical reactions or impairing the circulation during the latter stages of healing when the effects of ice can impede recovery. Research has shown that prophylactic use of ice AFTER exercise has been shown to reduce the severity of delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS). DOMS is thought to be the result of inﬂammation from muscle and connective tissue damaged caused directly by exercise (Jones et al.1986). The pro- phylactic use of ice after exercise on an area with a pre-existing inﬂammation can be very effective in reducing post-activity soreness. Low intensity, pulsed ultrasound is recommended in the acute phase. Continuous ultrasound at a high enough intensity to increase tissue temperature may be applied in conjunction with other manual ap- proaches in order to assist the resolution of a chronic problem accompanied by soft tissue shortening due to adhesions and scarring.

There is a risk of weakening the tendon par- ticularly in weight-bearing tendons. The weakness could lead to rupture. The elbow is not at as much risk as the hip, knee or ankle joint, although in cer- tain activities the upper limb could be considered weight-bearing but not to the same extent as the lower limb (Cameron 1995). In an acute injury it be- comes a more controversial decision to use this type of injection as it can impede the healing process by eliminating the inﬂammatory response. As the inﬂammatory response part of the healing process most doctors consider the use of steroid injections in acute injuries to be inappropriate. The evidence on corticosteroids injections for the treatment of tennis elbows is not conclusive (Assendelft et al.1996).

The wrist and hand combine to form an im- portant functional unit of the upper limb. This chap- ter will review the functional anatomy of the hand and wrist; explain the causative factors of acute soft tissue injuries of the hand and wrist; and discuss the differences between acute and chronic injuries of the hand and wrist. The chapter will further provide an overview of common soft tissue injuries of the hand and wrist by detailing the assessment, management, and rehabilitation strategies and protocols. Incidence of wrist and hand injuries Wrist and hand injuries are common in all types of sports. These injuries ranging from acute traumatic fractures, which can be seen in contact sports, such as football, rugby, hockey and basketball (Aitken and Court-Brown 2008), to chronic stress and overuse injuries, such as those seen in golf, gymnastics and various types of racquet sports (Rettig 2004). Over a 10-season period of American Football, more than 1385 injuries occurred to the hand, ﬁrst ray1 (metacarpals) and ﬁngers (Mall et al.2008). It was also reported in this study that offensive and defensive linemen were most likely to sustain hand injuries, due to the higher incidence of contact with opponents, accounting for over 80% of metacarpal 1Rays are the four radial grooves that separate the areas of the hand.

In addition, wide receivers and secondary defensive linemen were most likely to sustain ﬁnger type injuries, due to tackling while handling the ball (Mall et al.2008). In ﬁeld hockey, the odds of sus- taining a hand or ﬁnger type injury are signiﬁcantly greater (p < 0.01) than those participating in gloved wearing sports (Bowers et al.2008), an example be- ing ice hockey or lacrosse. The same risks also apply to cricket, as players have to handle the ball with bare hands (Stretch 2003). In basketball, the bulk of wrist and hands injuries can be clearly deﬁned as either cumulative (overuse) or acute (traumatic) (Raissaki et al.2007). Fur- thermore, the epidemiology of basketball injuries between 2005 and 2007 showed that basketball players were more likely to sustain injury during competition (3.27 per 1000 exposures), compared to that in training (1.94 per 1000 exposures) (Borowski et al.2008)."}

However, the differences seen in player handgrip position may offer some insight into such an injury, as the Eastern grip, Western or semi-Western grip, will determine either a radial or ulna pathology (Tagliaﬁco et al.2009).

The majority of golﬁng injuries for the hand and wrist occur from overuse of the common ﬂexor tendons (Batt 1992; Murray and Cooney 1996; Jacobson et al.2005; McHardy and Pollard 2005). Furthermore, this type of injury accounts for nearly 20% of all wrist injuries in amateur golf and a further 20–27% in professional golf (McHardy and Pollard 2005). Gymnastics poses another problem for athletes due to repetitive loading of the musculoskeletal sys- tem (Zlotolow and Bennett 2008), as the upper body is not speciﬁcally designed to cope with such high forces. As a result, the wrist is the second most in- jured site in gymnastics after the shoulder (Dobyns and Gabel 1990), which reﬂects the type of move- ment and apparatus used by athletes for this sport (Cainea and Nassarb 2005). By comparison, rock climbers face a speciﬁc type of injury to the hand and ﬁngers. As a strain to the ﬁnger ﬂexor system, termed a ‘pulley disruption’ (Zlotolow and Bennett 2008), is closely associated with the ‘crimp-grip’ hand po- sition, which is commonly used to hold onto smaller ledges (Jebson et al.1997; Klauser et al.2002)."}
{"id": "1887", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "In the ﬁeld of winter sports, it is not uncommon for snowboarders and skiers to sustain a different type of injury pattern (Sutherlandet al.1996), which highlights the importance of individually assessing the biomechanics of each sport. Although, the in- jury pattern for both brain and spinal injuries is considered the same in each sport (McBeth et al.2009). Despite this, the wrist (and forearm) and ankle are the most injured sites in snowboarding, at 23% (Biasca et al.1995; McBeth et al.2009), compared to that of the knee and thumb in alpine skiing, at 46%. Overall, the injury rate of snowboarders is compar- atively higher, which has important implications for the instruction of proper technique, especially when beginners are involved (Sutherland et al.1996). Sporting injuries of the wrist and hand are alto- gether not that uncommon, accounting for around a ﬁfth of all emergencies presented to medical units within the UK (Diasa and Garcia-Eliasb 2006)."}
{"id": "1888", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "In addition, over £100 million is spent per year in treat- ing those injuries (Diasa and Garcia-Eliasb 2006). Therefore, the sports rehabilitator should provide ad- equate assistance in successfully assessing and man- aging those injuries, if costs are to be minimalised and a greater understanding towards the process of injury prevention is developed, as each case history unfolds. Anatomy of the wrist and hand The anatomical structure of the wrist and hand is a complex network of superﬁcial soft tissue and palpable bony landmarks, whose role primarily, is to perform speciﬁc motor tasks that pertain to the shoulder and that of the elbow. These types of motor tasks often include hand and wrist actions such as blocking, gripping, catching and throwing, which can be seen being performed by most of today’s athletes in almost every sport. The structure and function of the wrist and hand are unique, in that the muscles, joints, tendons and ligaments all work together to provide stability, whilst enablingthethumbandfour ﬁngers toperform intricate and often delicate movements. However, when optimally trained, the hand can also provide powerful clasping and gripping movements, such as those seen in gymnastics, martial arts and rock climbing. The movements of the wrist and hand are not alto- gether exclusive, however, as the initial positioning and resultant joint actions are dependent on several muscles pertaining to the forearm. Therefore, care- ful consideration must be given to the whole kinetic chain when assessing and managing any type of injury to the upper extremity, as other joints may also be involved. Furthermore, a key understanding of the structure and function of the wrist and hand are vital for sports rehabilitator’s who may be embarking on careers in professional sport, as the diagnosis and management of musculoskeletal injuries could mean the difference between retirement and recovery. Bones The wrist and hand are comprised of 27 bones and more than 20 joints, of which there are 8 carpal bones, 5 metacarpal bones and 14 phalanges (Figure 19.1)."}
{"id": "1889", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The motion of these bones is somewhat com- plex, as movement occurs in three dimensions, and remains incompletely deﬁned (Moorea et al.2007). The scaphoid is the most commonly fractured bone of the carpals (Rizzo and Shin 2006), the mech- anism of injury occurring from a compression of the wrist while in extension, as during a block or fall. Blood ﬂow can also become disrupted, leading to complications in wound healing. Dislocations of the capitate with the lunate may also occur as a result of scaphoid fractures, termed a ‘perilunate dislocation’"}

Reproduced, with permission, from Principles of Anatomy and Physiology, (11th ed). Tortora, G. J., & Derrickson, B., (2006) (Bathala and Murray 2007). Here injury is as a result of forced extension, coupled with axial loading, and compression of the wrist. Joints The joints of the wrist and hand can be classi- ﬁed by their anatomical location and articulation with one another, to make up the radiocarpal joint (RC), midcarpal joint (MC), carpometacarpal joint (CMC), metacarpalphalangeal joint (MP), and inter- phalangeal joint (IP). Radiocarpal joint The radiocarpal joint of the wrist, which is formed by articulation of the radius with the scaphoid and lunate, and the triangular ﬁbrocartilage complex (TFCC), with the lunate and triquetral, is often re- ferred to as the common site for high intensive and chronic overuse injuries in sport (Bencardino and Rosenberg 2006; Tagliaﬁco et al 2009). The triangu- lar ﬁbrocartilage is particularly susceptible to injury by way of forced extension and pronation, giving rise to issues of joint instability, disc degeneration and force distribution between the distal radial and ulnar joints (Melone and Nathan 1992). Several liga- ments also aid in strengthening the radiocarpal joint (collateral, palmar and dorsal), allowing for move- ment in ﬂexion, extension, abduction and adduction. Midcarpal joint The midcarpal joint is formed by two rows of carpals, the proximal row (scaphoid, lunate, triquetral and pisiform) and the distal row (trapezium, trapezoid,"}
{"id": "1891", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "368 WRIST AND HAND INJURIES IN SPORT capitate and hamate). The carpal bones are closely packed together by intercarpal ligaments (dorsal, palmar and interosseous). As a result, ﬂexion and abduction of the wrist occur more at the midcarpal joint, with extension and adduction greater at the radiocarpal joint. Carpometacarpal joint The carpometacarpal joints of the hand are formed by close articulation with the distal row of carpals and the ﬁve metacarpal bones, with the ﬁrst car- pometacarpal joint, being that of the thumb, classed as separate. The carpometacarpal joints are held to- gether by dorsal and palmar ligaments, which allow for only a small degree of movement in joint glide. The thumb also has a lateral ligament, and due to its anatomical conﬁguration, allows for a greater range of movement than the opposing ﬁngers; allowing ﬂexion, extension, abduction, adduction, opposition and reposition. Metacarpalphalangeal joints The metacarpalphalageal joints are where the ﬁngers begin to become distinct from the hand. These are comprised of the ﬁve metacarpal bones articulating with the ﬁve proximal phalanges. The deep trans- verse metacarpal ligament holds all the MP joints together, allowing for ﬂexion, extension, abduction and adduction. The second and third MP joints are quite rigid, making up the major stabiliser for the hand, whereas the fourth and ﬁfth joints become in- creasingly mobile, in order to initiate the action that permits the closed grip of the hand."}
{"id": "1892", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The ﬁrst metacarpalphalangeal joint of the thumb is separate from the other MP joints, to allow for greater abduction and adduction. In addition, the collateral ligament complex also provides stability, allowing for the thumb to adopt any position on the palmar aspect of the hand, and to provide a preci- sion grip to the distal phalanges. An injury to the collateral ligament is particularly common in sports where the thumb is exposed, resulting in trauma from forced abduction and hyperextension, often from a direct contact with an opponent. In traumatic cir- cumstances such as this, the stability of the joint can become compromised, leading to the need for medical intervention and wound repair. Interphalangeal joints The interphalangeal joints of the ﬁngers are ex- pressed as the proximal PIP and distal DIP interpha- langeal joints, the DIP being furthest away from the hand. The interphalangeal joints are held closely to- gether by collateral ligaments, which remain taught in both ﬂexion and extension, unlike the collateral ligaments of the metacarpalphalageal joints, which are loose in extension. The collateral ligaments of the ﬁngers are a common injury sustained in phys- ical activity (Chomiak et al.2000; Shewring and Matthewson 1993), occurring mainly in ﬁeld and contact sports such as football and rugby. Muscles There are ﬁve muscles that act on the wrist joint. These are the ﬂexor group; ﬂexor carpi radialis, pal- maris longus and ﬂexor carpi ulnaris, and the exten- sor group; extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor carpi ulnaris (Figure 19.2)."}

There are several intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the hand, which co-exist to produce movement for the thumb and ﬁngers. Three extrinsic muscles act on all four ﬁngers. These include ﬂexor digitorum su- perﬁcialis, ﬂexor digitorum profundus and extensor digitorum. Two smaller muscles also help to assist with extension of the index ﬁnger and ﬁfth ﬁnger, respectively. These are extensor indicis and extensor digiti minimi. Disruption of the ﬁnger ﬂexor ten- don pulley is one of the most frequently occurring injuries in rock climbing, due to bowstringing of the tendon during the closed ‘crimp-hand’ position (Sch¨ofﬂand Sch¨ofﬂ2006). Considerable friction has also been shown to be apparent in a study by Moora, Nagya, Snedekera and Schweizer (2009), reporting that the ﬁngers, particularly at 90-degree ﬂexion, stress the PIP joint. There are a total of 11 intrinsic muscles in the hand that act upon the proximal phalanges and middle and distal phalanges.

After completion of the subjective portion of the assessment, which includes detailing both personal details and medical history, the reha- bilitator should now begin to conduct the objective portion, which involves the physical assessment. Objective assessment Palpation Palpation should occur with the athlete seated, with the forearm, wrist and hand in a relaxed position. Because of the superﬁcial nature and complexity of the wrist and hand, a thorough knowledge of struc- tural and functional anatomy should be gained be- forehand in order to understand the extent of any musculoskeletal injury Range of motion Wrist and hand motions occur in a variety of differ- ent planes, which can often be thought of as corre- sponding to the joint actions of the elbow and the shoulder. Testing includes active and passive move- ments for the wrist in ﬂexion, extension, radial and ulnar deviation, MCP joints in ﬂexion, extension, ab- duction and adduction, and interphalangeal joints in ﬂexion and extension. The thumb is also included in ﬂexion and extension, and also abduction, adduction and circumduction. The purpose of range of mo- tion assessment is to assess physiological and acces- sory motion, to differentiate injury between anatom- ical structures, and to assess end feel for abnormal movement. Special testing Special tests of the wrist and hand extend to phys- iological, neurological and also vascular examina- tions, to conclude or exclude pathology. These tests include examinations to both soft tissue and bony articulations, for the presence of acute and chronic inﬂammation, stress fractures and underlying medi- cal conditions."}

For the purposes of review, the most common injuries will be discussed, together with as- sessment and conservative management, according to scope of practice for GRSs, who operate exclu- sively within the UK. The full list of injuries, how- ever, can be seen illustrated as they are presented according to each sport (Table 19.1). Acute soft tissue injuries Athletes participating in high intensive and contact sports will no doubt be affected by acute soft tissue injuries.

Reproduced, with permission, from Clinical Practice of Sports Injury Prevention and Care: Olympic Encyclopaedia of Sports Medicine, Volume V. Renstrom, P. A., F., H., (1994) Management In the immediate instance of injury to the ulnar col- lateral ligament, ice packs and compression are the best forms of treatment (Janoff 1999). Ultrasound can also be effective in the early stages to diagnose injury (Chuter et al.2009; Malik et al.2009), fol- lowed by massage and mobilisation, to aid in liga- ment repair and restore function (Alexy and De Carlo 1998). Thumb strength and dexterity can also be im- proved by using hand therapy balls and therapeu- tic putty (Alexy and De Carlo 1998; Shafer-Crane 2006; Wilson et al.2008), whereas grip and thumb strengthening devices may be useful in restoring nor- mal hand and thumb motion. Complications in healing Where there is a complete rupture of the ulnar collat- eral ligament, further medical intervention may be necessary. As in some cases the ruptured ligament may have become entangled in the soft tissue at the base of the thumb, known as a “Stener lesion”, which will further complicate the procedure for con- servative management and present a delay in wound healing (Ebrahim et al.2006)."}
{"id": "1902", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Although, ruptured ul- nar collateral ligaments without Stener lesions, have a good capacity to heal without complication. Fol- lowing successful rehabilitation, return to sporting activities is possible. Returning to full sport is con- sidered once the athlete has regained full functional ROM, with 90% strength of the unaffected part, and pain and swelling are minimal (Stracciolini et al.2007). Injury prevention For football (soccer) goalkeepers and rugby players, preventative taping can be effective in aiding thumb joint stability and preventing further injury, and in sports where no catching is required, a thumb brace can also provide an alternative means to a permanent wrist support (Alexy and De Carlo 1998) Mallet finger Another common injury sustained in ﬁeld and con- tact sports is mallet ﬁnger. Mallet ﬁnger is sustained from forceful ﬂexion of an extended distal DIP joint, such as when a player has mistimed a shot or catch- ing the ball. Signs and symptoms An athlete with mallet ﬁnger will present with pain at the dorsal DIP joint, with an inability to actively ex- tend the joint, demonstrating a characteristic ﬂexion deformity. If the tendon is only partially stretched, then movement may be restricted by 15–20 degrees extension. However, if a full rupture is present, then movement will be limited by 30–40 degrees exten- sion, although full passive motion is typically pre- served (Micheo 2003). Management The majority of mallet ﬁnger injuries are treated conservatively with rehabilitation."}
{"id": "1903", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Ice packs can be useful to relieve pain in the early stages. The terminal interphalangeal joint (the joint in the ﬁnger closest to its tip) should be splinted in slight hyperextension (an overly straightened position), without immobilising any of the other joints of the injured ﬁnger (Janoff 1999). This position can then be maintained to allow time for wound healing."}
{"id": "1904", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "374 WRIST AND HAND INJURIES IN SPORT Treatment Treatment includes active DIP ﬂexion exercises (making a full ﬁst) that act to regain strength and mobility of the injured ﬁnger. This should be prac- tised without the splint for 10 minutes every hour for the ﬁrst two weeks (Teoh and Lee 2007), followed by several weeks of DIP ﬂexion exercises with an extended PIP joint (Walshaw 2004). Complications in healing It is important to isolate the DIP joint during evalua- tion to ensure extension is from the extensor tendon and not the central slip, the absence of full passive extension possibly indicating a bony or soft tissue en- trapment (Bach 1999; Lee and Montgomery 2002). Furthermore, bony avulsion fractures are present in one-third of patients with mallet ﬁnger, (Lairmore and Engber 1998; Palmer 1998). Injury prevention In sports such as basketball, cricket, and rugby it may be sensible to tape the ﬁngers to provide further support to the joints. In individuals with a previous history, it is wise to wear a ﬁnger splint as protection. Jersey finger A disruption of the ﬂexor digitorum profundus ten- don, also known as jersey ﬁnger, commonly occurs when an athlete’s ﬁnger catches on another player’s clothing, usually while playing a team sport such as football or rugby. As the athlete pulls away, the ﬁnger is forcibly straightened while the profundus ﬂexor tendon continues to contract. The ring ﬁnger is the weakest digit of the four ﬁngers, accounting for 75% of all reported cases (Hankins and Peel 1990). Signs and symptoms An athlete with jersey ﬁnger will present with pain and swelling at the volar aspect of the DIP joint, and will be unable to bend the tip of the affected ﬁnger."}
{"id": "1905", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Tenderness may also felt elsewhere along the ﬁnger or hand, if the profundus tendon has become retracted. The digitorum profundus tendon can be evaluated by holding the affected ﬁnger’s MCP and PIP joints in extension while the rest remain in ﬂex- ion, and performing a concentric contraction of the affected DIP joint (Hankins and Peel 1990). A posi- tive sign for rupture to the digitorum profundus ten- don is that the DIP joint should not move. Management Immediate management of jersey ﬁnger includes di- agnostic imaging to conﬁrm suspicion of an avul- sion fracture, as complications can quickly arise in the case of tendon retractions (Mastey et al.1997). Athletes with conﬁrmed or suspected jersey ﬁnger should also be referred for medical consultation. Fol- lowing medical intervention, rehabilitation should consist of passive range of motion exercises followed by a return to normal activity only after a period of several weeks, during which time movement is re- stricted in order to promote wound repair. Boutonni`ere deformity A common injury to the central slip extensor ten- don (boutonni`ere deformity) occurs when the PIP joint is forcibly ﬂexed while actively extended. It is a common injury among basketball players. Volar dislocation of the PIP joint can also cause central slip tendon ruptures (Perron et al."}

Sign and symptoms Signs and symptoms of boutonni`ere deformity in- clude pain and localised swelling to the PIP joint. The PIP joint should be evaluated by holding the joint in a position of 15–30 degrees of ﬂexion. If the PIP joint is injured, then the athlete will be unable to actively extend the joint, however, passive extension will be possible. Tenderness over the dorsal aspect of the middle phalanx will also be present. Management The PIP joint should be splinted in full extension for the ﬁrst six weeks of healing, and in cases where no avulsion has taken place, or the avulsion involves less than one third of the joint. All available splints can be used to treat PIP injuries, except for the stack splint, which is used only for DIP injuries. As with mallet ﬁnger, extension of the PIP joint must be maintained continuously. If full passive extension is not possible, then the rehabilitator should refer the athlete."}

A boutonni`ere deformity usually develops over a period of several weeks, as the intact lateral bands of the extensor tendon slip inferiorly. However, a boutonni`ere de- formity will also occur more acutely. Injury prevention In sports such as basketball, cricket, and rugby it may be sensible to tape the ﬁngers to provide further support to the joints. Athletes with PIP joint injuries may also continue to participate in athletic events during the splinting period, although some sports are difﬁcult to play with a fully extended PIP joints. Extensor pollicis longus rupture A tendon rupture of the extensor pollicis longus (EPL) is a recognised complication of distal radial fractures and their ﬁxation with dorsal radial plates and pins. A number of other conditions including internal ﬁxation of wrist fractures and inﬂammatory arthropathies have also been reported as aetiological factors of EPL tendon rupture (Ansede et al.2009). Management The EPL tendon is complex and if a rupture occurs then medical intervention may be necessary. The standard procedure for this type of injury is to use the extensor indicis proprius (EIP) tendon."}
{"id": "1908", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The tendon is then transferred from its normal location to replace the function of the EPL. There however some disad- vantages to using the EIP, as Bullon (2007) states that the EPL may not have sufﬁcient tendons, therefore using the accessory abductor pollicis longus (AAPL) is preferred, as transference can then be conducted without affecting the function of the APL. Complications in healing Not all people have this tendon, as it is present in approximately 85% of the general population. How- ever, Bullon (2007) states that the AAPL could be used successfully in restoring function of the rup- tured EPL, as everyday newer surgical procedures are being conducted, which have many advantages over other tendon transfers for this type of injury. Wimsey, Kurian and Jeffery (2006) also state that there is a conservative approach to this condition, which would be to immobilise the wrist joint in a mallet splint for 12 weeks. However, this approach would only be advocated to the younger population, as complications can occur from immobilisation of the joints, such as muscle atrophy and weakness, which will hinder effective management. Other acute soft tissue injuries Triangular fibrocartilage complex tears The triangular ﬁbrocartilage complex (TFCC) sits between the distal end of the ulna and the tri- quetrum and part of the lunate. It consists of the tri- angular ﬁbrocartilage, the ulnar meniscus homolog, the ulnar collateral ligament, carpal ligaments and the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon sheath. Testing for the TFCC is to place the wrist in extension and ulnar deviation and then rotate. This movement, as in the forehand volley, relates to overloading of the com- plex."}
{"id": "1909", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The integrity of the TFCC is closely bound up with the stability of the distal radio-ulnar joint (DRUJ). In a study by Adlercreutz, Aspenberg and Lindau (2000), it was shown that a complete tear of the TFCC is almost always associated with instability of the DRUJ. Instability of the DRUJ is also associated with generalised capsuloligamentous laxity. Often pain on the ulnar side of the wrist is multifactorial and stability-related. Another underlying cause of compression injuries to the TFCC is ulnar variance. Collateral ligament sprains Collateral ligament injuries of the MCP, PIP and IP joints can occur in many types of sport. Injuries of the collateral ligaments of the MCP joints are seldom but instability can present if the tear is complete. Injury to the PIP joint is quite common in athletes and team sports such as volleyball, basketball and rugby. The majority of collateral ligament injuries can be treated by splinting or taping the affected part to the adjacent ﬁngers, known as ‘buddy taping’, in order to provide additional support (Sennet 2004).

Wrist sprains Wrist sprains typically occur after a trip or fall, re- sulting in stretching or tearing of the ligaments of the wrist. Common causes of wrist sprain include falls during team sports, such as when a basketball player is tackled during a jump shot, or a rugby player barged from the side. Moreover, if the tissues are inﬂexible and weak, the risk of injury increases. However, the majority of these injuries can be treated conservatively, and seldom result in prolonged loss of sporting activity. Contusions Contusions of the wrist and hand are a common injury, because of the many superﬁcial tendons and bony prominences that are exposed. Contusions are rarely serious, and can be treated conservatively over time. However, care must be taken not to rule out more serious injury, such as ligament sprains, tendon injuries and joint fractures. Chronic and overuse injuries Repetitive actions can take their toll in team and ac- tion sports, resulting in chronic inﬂammatory issues and degenerative pathologies. The repetitive cycle of injury that can occur from an acute injury that is poorly managed is also a source of chronic instabil- ity, resulting in faulty recruitment from scar tissue, chronic inﬂammation and irritation from repetitive forces."}
{"id": "1911", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "In sports such as tennis, gymnastics and rock climbing, the wrists are exposed to a greater fre- quency of joint irritation, from the dissipation of load through the upper extremity.

De Quervain’s disease De Quervain’s disease (also known as Hoffmann’s disease) is an inﬂammation and thickening of the synovial lining of the common sheath of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons (Figure 19.5).

Therefore, space inside the sheath is limited. Thickening occurs particularly at the dis- tal portion of the radial styloid. There is often pain in resisted thumb extension and abduction, and while passively moving the wrist in ulnar deviation, keep- ing the thumb fully ﬂexed (Finkelstein’s test) (Van Tulder et al.2007). There is also local tenderness on palpation, and with the tendon on stretch, crepitus to repeated movements. Management De Quervain’s disease responds well to frictional massage with the tendons in a lengthened position, and immobilisation of the thumb joint in a splint (McCarroll 2001; Coldham 2006). Corticosteroid in- jections may also be prescribed for persistent cases (Mason et al.2008). Complications in healing De Quervain’s disease can often be confused with rheumatoid arthritis (Daenen et al."}
{"id": "1913", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2004). However, imaging for tendon pathology, such as in the use of sonography, can accurately determine a number of inﬂammatory, metabolic and infectious wrist disor- ders (Daenen et al.2004). Injury prevention Breaking the cycle of injury comes highly recom- mended for managing de Quervain’s disease (Rettig 2004), as a wide variety of ergonomic factors are re- lated to its onset. The cessation of repetitive activity is the ﬁrst recommendation, followed by the reduc- tion in movements that cause pain and the reporting of symptoms (Foye et al.2002). In this instance, breaking the cycle is as much about educating the athlete on the long-term health beneﬁts. Other chronic and overuse injuries Carpal tunnel syndrome Carpal tunnel syndrome is a result of compres- sion of the medial nerve as it passes beneath the ﬂexor retinaculum and into the carpal tunnel. The condition may manifest as a result of swelling of the ﬂexor tendon sheaths (tenosynovitis), as can be seen from the repetitive ﬂexion actions caused by the wrist in sports such as gymnastics, cycling and weightlifting. The condition can also manifest itself as a result of arthritic degenerative changes from repetitive or previous impact traumas, such as wrist fractures."}
{"id": "1914", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Ulnar nerve compression Compression injuries of the ulnar nerve can oc- cur between the wrist space formed between the pisiform and the hamate, known as the tunnel of Guyon, termed “Guyon’s canal syndrome”. The symptoms are caused by compression or friction of soft tissue structures surrounding the ulnar nerve, resulting in pain, tingling and numbness. The con- dition commonly affects cyclists, as the wrist is compressed and extended against the handlebars (Figure 19.6). Impingement syndrome This condition can manifest as a result of forced compression of two carpal bones of the wrist. Such injuries include impaction between the scaphoid or, less commonly, the lunate and radius with forced extension, triquetrohamate impingement with forced extension and ulnar deviation, and radial styloid impaction with forced radial deviation. Impingement syndrome may also relate to chronic instabilities, whereby increased accessory joint motion refers to greater chances of impingement during physiologi- cal movement. Trigger finger Trigger ﬁnger, is a common name for ﬁnger tendon disruption that causes the joints to prevent from ex- tending. As the ﬁnger bends a nodule on the tendon passes out of the synovial sheath coating the tendon and into the palm, but as the ﬁnger straightens the nodule may not pass back into the sheath, becom- ing lodged in its entrance. The athlete may attempt to forcibly straighten the ﬁnger but this should be avoided in all circumstances."}

Reproduced, with permission, from Clinical Practice of Sports Injury Prevention and Care: Olympic Ency- clopaedia of Sports Medicine, Volume V. Renstrom, P. A., F., H., (1994) Bone pathology Scaphoid fracture A scaphoid fracture is the most commonly injured bone of the carpals. Often occurring from sudden impact of a closed wrist or during a trip or fall, with the wrist in full extension. The injury is particularly common in contact sports, such as American foot- ball, rugby and martial arts, but it may also occur in other types of sports, such as gymnastics, skiing or snowboarding. Signs and symptoms An athlete with a scaphoid fracture will present with swelling at the base of the thumb, on the outside of the wrist (anatomical snuffbox). Palpation will elicit pain, particularly with passive movements dur- ing pronation and ulnar deviation, which will stress the scaphoid. It is also not uncommon for a scaphoid fracture to go undetected, and in the event, diagnos- tic imaging is highly recommended (Haisman et al.2006). Management Acute management of scaphoid fractures is immo- bilisation of the wrist and thumb (Jones 2006), where a support would extend from the wrist to the IP joint of the thumb, but also sometimes from the elbow. Rehabilitation in the early stage begins with main- taining range of movement in the shoulder and the elbow, and, in less complicated fractures, healing can be resolved in as little as four weeks."}
{"id": "1916", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "In more complicated fractures, however, such as a fracture to the proximal bone, healing may take several months. Therefore, maintaining muscle function in the upper extremity is imperative, to prevent loss of movement. Once healing has been approved, mobilisation and strengthening exercises using therapeutic putty and hand therapy balls can begin to restore full function (Vucekovich et al.2004). During this period it may also be helpful to wear a wrist support when not performing exercise to aid further support. Complications in healing Early diagnosis of scaphoid injuries is important, as misdiagnosed or untreated fractures may lead to malunion or nonunion bone (Haisman et al.2006). Athletes with these problems would most certainly present with later issues, as persistent wrist pain and abnormal kinematics can lead to wrist arthro- sis. Medical intervention using screw ﬁxation may be recommended in most cases, as evidence suggests that conservative management may lead to a higher rate of non-union complications during healing (McQueen et al.2008)."}

However, in snowboarding the incidence of scaphoid injury is less due to the measure of wearing wrist guards. As wrist guards have been shown to reduce the incidence of wrist injuries during falls (O’Neill 2003; Idzikowski et al.2000). Other bone pathologies Metacarpal fractures A punching type injury is the most common cause of metacarpal fractures. This may occur either when the hand strikes another object (hand off), such as in handball, or when a player falls with a closed ﬁst hitting another solid object. Sports involving this type of injury include American football, boxing, basketball, soccer and in some cases cricket. Bennett's fracture A Bennett’s fracture of the thumb (ﬁrst metacarpal bone) is similar in mechanism to an MCP fracture. Except in this case impact is speciﬁcally targeted at the thumb. In this instance the pull of the abduc- tor muscle causes displacement of the metacarpal bone, resulting in shearing of the bone at its base."}

Finger fractures Finger fractures are very common in basketball, and can be caused by a variety of mechanisms. While ﬁnger fractures are often considered minor trauma, without proper treatment they can also cause ma- jor problems. Conservative management involves buddy taping or splinting while the injured bone heals (Sennet 2004), and to prevent further injury. These types of fractures are also sometimes referred to as hairline fractures, small avulsion fractures, and non-displaced fractures. PIP joint dislocations Dislocation of the PIP joint is common in sports such as handball, basketball and cricket. The mechanism of injury can occur in axial loading and hyperexten- sion of the joint, lateral loading and, more rarely, volar disruption of the PIP joint. Lack of treatment may cause permanent joint deformity, and in the case of more traumatic PIP dislocations, fractures may also be present.

He was indoor-climbing during the weekend and fell, whilst holding onto a rock wall with bolt-on features."}

Since then his symp- toms have become much worse. The management of this athlete are discussed, following the head- ings of injury management, immediate treatment, restoration of motion, muscular strength endurance and power, and functional integration. Injury management Active rehabilitation methods are highly rec- ommended, due to the increased instances of joint contractures and deformity for ﬁnger type injuries. Cessation of ﬁnger type activities is also desired at this point (Wyatt et al.1996) to localise inﬂammation and reduce instances of pain. Athletic taping, however, is not recommended at this point, especially without prior medical consultation, as research is still not yet conclusive for the efﬁcacy of taping for rock climbing injuries (Bollen and Gunson 1990). Diagnostic imaging can also be advised at this time, to determine the extent of trauma to the ﬁnger pulley (Klauser et al 2002). Immediate treatment In the instance of acute injury and soft-tissue strains, several therapeutic interventions are propagated, in- cluding ultrasound (US), interferential stimulation (IFS) and ice-massage (Janoff 1999). US and ice- massage may be used in combination with exer- cise to decrease inﬂammation, the duration and frequency depending upon the severity of injury."}

Flexibility exercises may also be performed using either cryokinetic techniques or as inﬂammation decreases, heat, to facilitate motion. Restoration of motion Once pain-free motion and soft-tissue ﬂexibility have been restored, close chain exercises can then be prescribed to improve dexterity. The exercises used here should be the same or similar to those used in functional testing, as this will mark any im- provements and already be familiar to the athlete. The methods used can also include the precision- grip or power-grip, as used in rock climbing, with speciﬁc modiﬁcations selected based on detriments in performance. Muscular strength endurance and power Once range-of-motion and dexterity have been established, open-chain exercises speciﬁc to the physiological demands of rock climbing can then be prescribed, including a progression of movements using hand weights and body weight, building the in- tensity until the athlete can manage 25–30 repetitions (Read 2000). Athletic taping may also be used at this point but only a preventative measure, to provide further joint stability (Jebson et al.1997). It is im- portant to note that this phase of rehabilitation is now beyond the scope of most conventional allied health professionals and is speciﬁc to sports rehabilitators."}

Functional Integration If, after a period of periodisation, the athlete is able to perform maximal strength and power tests bilater- ally, the rehabilitator can then introduce movements that replicate the technical aspects of the sport. The biomechanics of indoor and sports climbing demand that most of the body is supported by the distal pha- lanx, and while the crimp-grip technique is mainly used, it is often the position of frequent ruptures (Vigourioux et al.2008). Therefore, the rehabili- tation goal here is to restore the ability for distal phalanx to cope with the transference and dissipation of load. Taking the athlete back to the onsite location Figure 19.7 Observation of climbing technique. Cour- tesy of Fabio Jesus of the initial injury will also be helpful to assess movement and correct technique, should the athlete wish to continue with a sports-speciﬁc training programme with the rehabilitator (Figure 19.7). Furthermore, the rate of adaptation required will be unique to each individual and level of athletic ability. Therefore, the rehabilitator would do well to evaluate the needs of each athlete, and assessments and feedback should almost become second nature for each stage of the rehabilitation process.

The anatomy of the groin can be clinically difﬁcult to deﬁne. Both structures can be deﬁned primarily by posi- tion concerning the groin, and by function regarding the hip, within the musculoskeletal structure of the body. The hip joint allows the lower limb to be moved through an exceptional range of motion, although the movement in the hip joint is more anterior and pos- terior due to anatomical structure and the functional requirement of gait. The groin consists of the structures deep to the anterior and medial intersection of the leg and the lower abdomen, and includes the structures of the perineum. Movement of the hip underlies and effects the groin structures. Stretching and mobility exercises of the hip involve the groin muscles. The groin, therefore, particularly includes the lower rec- tus abdominis musculature, the inguinal region, the symphysis pubis, the upper portions of the adductor muscles of the thigh, and the genitalia, including the scrotum in males. This chapter introduces common groin injuries and pathologies associated with sport and physi- cal activity participation. The chapter provides an overview of the functionality of both the groin and hip and then details the injuries and pathologies through evidence based analyses of the literature."}

When reading this chapter it is important to understand injury, pain and pathology in the light of function, and more often dysfunction, of joint motion. Groin pain in sport Groin pain is one of the most poorly understood syndromes in clinical sports medicine despite its rel- atively common occurrence. There are many opin- ions and theories describing the causes of groin pain (Bradshaw et al.2008), particularly in sport but many commonly held assumptions are unsupported by ro- bust scientiﬁc evidence. There is much signiﬁcant discussion in the sports medicine literature as to whether groin pain is caused predominantly by: r a single pathology, presenting in various ways r one of multiple distinct entities that need to be accurately diagnosed and treated differently r several merging pathologies that coexist, result- ing in a similar syndrome that requires almost the same treatment, no matter what the present- ing symptomatology.

{"id": "1942", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "386 THE GROIN IN SPORT Part of the explanation, for the resulting unsatis- factory causal and diagnostic opinions, lies in the complex anatomy of the groin. Patients very of- ten become uncertain and despondent after receiv- ing varied opinions from different highly respected clinicians only to receive conﬂicting and confusing information as to the diagnosis and the way the con- dition should be managed, treated and rehabilitated. The groin is a relatively unstable area, acting as the link between structures that generate large forces through it. Groin pain can therefore be related to several different joints, particularly the lumbar spine, sacroiliac, hip and pubic symphysis; the adductor, hip ﬂexor, gluteal, abdominal and lumbar extensor muscle groups; and even the obturator, ilioinguinal and genitofemoral neural structures (Noiseux and Tanzer 2008). Functional anatomy (Figures 20.1 and 20.2) The pelvis is a ring of bone with the symphysis pubis joint anteriorly and the two sacroiliac joints posteriorly. It links the hip joints at each side and the spine posteriorly. Instability in the pelvic ring may make it difﬁcult to diagnose symptoms, and repetitive stress on the pelvic bone itself may cause a stubborn stress fracture. The gluteal muscles provide stability and generate signiﬁcant power during hip joint movement. They are important for the transference of power between the legs and the trunk in sport. The gluteus maximus extends the hip and therefore particularly contributes to propulsion and strong anti-gravity stability when balancing or pivoting on one leg."}
{"id": "1943", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Gluteus medius and minimus move the leg away from the midline and are important stabilisers of the pelvis. Weakness of these muscles may well contribute to pain in the groin. The hip ﬂexor muscles bring the thigh forward during running and kicking. They are made up of the iliopsoas muscle combination. The Psoas muscle originates from the lumbar spine and travels through the posterior part of the abdomen and beneath the inguinal ligament to attach on the upper part of the thigh bone. Iliacus originates from inside the pelvic bone and joins psoas towards the thigh. Importantly the iliopsoas connects the lumbar spine directly to the thigh over the front of the hip joint.

{"id": "1944", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Hip adductor muscles connect the central pubic bone of the pelvis to the medial thigh. They move the active leg toward and past the midline of the body in activities like kicking diagonally across the body. They also stabilise the supporting limb during move- ments that require balancing on one limb, such as in the repetitive kicking in karate. The adductor mus- cles can be strained, torn or even ruptured, usually more proximal than distal (Tuite et al.1998; Lohrer and Nauck 2007). The rectus abdominis, internal and external oblique and transversus abdominis abdominal mus- cles all combine to perform pelvic movement and contribute towards stability in the trunk and pelvic region. Strength imbalance and dysfunction of these muscles (Maffey and Emery 2007) may contribute to groin related symptoms. Weakness of the lower abdominal muscles (Morales-Conde 2009) may be related in a condition known as ‘sportsman’s hernia’."}

Pain and dysfunction in other structures around the pelvis may cause secondary reactive tightness in this sheet of muscle (Kibler et al.2006). The speciﬁc posterior attachment to the pelvis combined with tension in this muscle may result in an anterior tilt of the pelvis (Hibbs et al.2008), causing impingement and torsion to the structures of particularly the anterior groin. The biomechanics around the pelvis is such that dysfunction and imbalance of any one or more of these anatomical structures can therefore result in disconnection in the chain of movement, especially in the complex and stressful environment of sport (Meyers et al.2008).

In an Australian study of elite football players, Verrall et al. (2007) suggested that the development of chronic groin injury may be preceded by loss of hip mobility. There are several guiding tests for range and symmetry of hip movement including medial rotation (Figure 20.3; Verrall 2005) and the modi- ﬁed Thomas test (Figure 20.4). The Thomas test in particular can be a differential indicator of hip ﬂexor related pathology on the stretch side, or hip impinge- ment on the compression side. The most common injuries can be divided into acute and chronic accounting for approximately 5% of the cases attending sports injury clinics (Hackney 2008). The most common acute injuries are soft- tissue contusions and haematomas encountered in contact sports like football, ice hockey, basketball and rugby that result from direct impact but some- times non-contact sports like gymnastics (Junge et al.2006). Acute muscle strains are commonly encoun- tered in activities in which loaded adduction of the hip occurs, like football (Ibrahim et al.2007), rugby, ice hockey and breaststroke swimming, or in activ- ities where forced abduction of the hip occurs as in any sporting activity in which the sportsperson may perform a split, either accidentally or deliberately."}

The most common chronic conditions are strains of the muscle and tendon (Amaral 1997). Repetitive acute groin injuries may become the cause of chronic or overuse injuries (Holmich 2007). Chronic groin injuries tend to occur in those who participate in activities that promote overuse of the groin area like ice hockey, skating, football and running (Maffey and Emery 2007). The iliotibial band, hip ﬂexor, gluteal and adductor muscles run from the pelvis to the knee, aiding hip stability. Where an imbalance exists between these very strong muscle groups which are necessary to lift and propel the leg, and those of the abdomen, the sportsperson may experience imbalance detrimental to performance as well as being more injury suscep- tible (Machotka et al.2009). Sometimes, wear and tear on the hip leads to os- teoarthritis (Spector et al.1996), usually in the older athlete, but trauma in the younger athlete in as much as 50% can instigate increased wear early (Bradshaw et al.2008)."}

Groin injuries are found in athletes of all ages at all levels of competition. They are particularly common in activities where strong and particularly repetitive adduction of the hip occurs, like football, skating and swimming. As many as 5% of soccer-related in- juries are groin injuries (Gilmore 1998). They are often a result of quick, lateral movements (Ziltener and Leal 2007), usually in combination with accel- eration made from a standing start (Johnson 1997). Football, rugby and tennis are sports where there is a signiﬁcant incidence of this type of groin stress. The least debilitating of the groin injuries is often called a groin pull, or strain. Like other strains, this is usually caused by an overstretching under load, of the lower abdominal muscles or adductors, particularly where hips are restricted (Ibrahim et al.2007), causing the muscle to stretch and sustain a minor or worse tear. A typical mild groin strain will usually resolve with rest and management over one or two weeks."}

Special consideration must be given to females (Kark and Kurzer 2008), children and adolescents with groin pain, as they may have conditions that are more serious and need medical or surgical inter- vention. Pain in the adolescent athlete must take into consideration the susceptible growth plate in the hip. Apophysitis and apophyseal fractures are more com- mon in adolescent athletes, where the growth plate may be a weak link in the area (Longacre 1994). Also, children, adolescents and adults may report knee pain that is actually referred from pathology in the hip, which must always be considered when no knee pathology is demonstrated on examination (Tomoko et al.2006).

Many patients with groin pain have more than one injury, often leading to managing one injury whilst a second is missed and untreated (Putukian et al.1997). Therefore the importance of a comprehensive differential diagnosis is clearly justiﬁed (Harmon 2007). Impact injuries Impact injuries, such as those that occur during foot- ball, hockey, or other contact sports, may result in contusions. However, such injuries may cause frac- tures of the pelvis; exacerbate previously asymp- tomatic inguinal hernias; and, in rare cases, produce bladder, testicular, or even urethral injuries. Any pa- tient with lower abdominal or pelvic impact injury that causes severe groin pain, loss of function, or blood in the urine should be immediately medically investigated. If no bony injury is discovered, conser- vative measures may be implemented. Hip pointer The hip pointer can arise from both direct contusion causing impact and indirect strain injuries of the hip, primarily in contact sports.

It is important that the sportsperson does not re- turn too quickly to activity. If they still have pain or tenderness, they are liable to compensate by alter- ing the movement pattern and technique which may result in injury to another part of the body. Classic groin strain, ‘pull’ or adductor tendinopathy The most frequent acute strain of the groin may in- volve single or multiple muscles, including the iliop- soas, adductors and the gracilis, which attach to the femur or pubis and help to stabilise the legs and ﬂex the thigh. The muscle most commonly strained and injured in the groin is the adductor longus (Harmon 2007). Other muscles that must be considered in- clude the rectus femoris, the rectus abdominis and the sartorius. Falling, running, changing direction, kicking or doing the splits may generate these injuries. Groin strains usually cause pain in the groin and radiate down the inside of the thigh, more proximal than distal, with pain on resisted adduction of the hip. There may be confusion on occasions as MRI and ultrasound studies will often report changes at the adductor attachment, when the patient is completely asymptomatic in that area. Occasionally there may be haematoma formation which can prolong the healing time."}
{"id": "1957", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The weakened area created by a strain may continue to be suscep- tible to repeated injury for a long time (Lynch and Renstr¨om 1999). In fact, in a review of ice hockey players, those with a previous groin injury had twice the risk of repeat injuries as that of athletes with- out a previous injury (Emery and Meeuwisse 2001). Older, experienced hockey players had an injury rate ﬁve times higher than that of novice players (Emery et al.1999). In another review in ice hockey, the statistics re- vealed that adductor strains occurred 20 times more frequently during training camps rather than dur- ing the playing season (Caudill et al.2008), pos- sibly related to the beneﬁts of a strength-training programme and to the fact that out- of- season lack of maintenance conditioning may contribute to groin injuries. Sometimes in explosive sports, the adductor ten- don may fully rupture, and even pull away from its osseous attachment, taking a piece of the bone with it. These are called avulsion fractures and if they cause severe displacement, surgical repair may be indicated. Most groin strains are mild, however, and eventually respond to conservative treatment. Unfor- tunately, adductor tendon pathology often coexists with other dysfunction around the pelvic region."}
{"id": "1958", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Treatment and rehabilitation Adductor tendon strains may be treated speciﬁcally if the symptoms are very localised and imaging is consistent with the clinical observations. Soft-tissue release techniques to reduce tightness can be com- bined with progressive strengthening of the adductor muscles. However, it is very important that treatment should be accompanied by attention to any other strength (Figures 20.5 and 20.6; Holmich et al.2004; Verrall 2005) or ﬂexibility deﬁciencies in the pelvic area. The adductors work with gluteus medius after propulsion in running; and with the hip abductors to maintain pelvic stability during the stance phase, therefore it is considered that pelvic stability pre- vents excessive eccentric loading of the adductors (Figures 20.7–20.10). Strain of the adductor longus should be managed depending on the location of the injury. Physical examination should reveal whether the injury lies within the muscle belly or within the teno-periosteal attachment (Schilders et al.2007). Injuries to the muscle belly are best managed with strengthening, gentle stretching and progressive re- turn to activity. However, avulsion injury to the teno-periosteal attachment requires more conservative management with rest until the patient is pain free, then strength- ening and very careful stretching over a signiﬁcantly longer period of weeks; then running and sprint- ing; and, lastly, running and sprinting combined with rapid changes in direction if the sport demands it."}

Proximal thigh strapping during activity will often be successful in dissipating stress away from the weakened area. When all conservative measures (Verrall et al.2007) have failed, surgical release of the tendon from the bone called an adductor tenotomy may be indi- cated. Although adductor tenotomy has been shown to leave a strength deﬁcit in some studies, this does not appear to signiﬁcantly be associated with adverse performance. Iliopsoas syndrome The iliopsoas muscle is comprised of two muscles that work together, the iliacus and psoas. The main function is ﬂexion of the hip, a fundamental sport movement as in running and kicking. In between the proximal iliopsoas tendon and the hip joint lies the psoas bursa, which helps to reduce friction. Il- iopsoas syndrome is inﬂammation of the iliopsoas bursa and/or iliopsoas tendonopathy, and is often found in conjunction with adductor abnormalities. It more frequently occurs in sports with repetitive hip ﬂexion like gymnastics and athletics."}

Treatment and rehabilitation The condition will often settle down with ice treat- ment, rest, support and initial anti-inﬂammatory medication. When the acute pain has diminished, a programme of progressive ﬂexibility (Figures 20.3 and 20.4) and strengthening exercises for the struc- tures around the hip should be followed by an in- cremental return to full activity (Torry et al.2006). Core strengthening exercises to help improve the sta- bility of the trunk and pelvis (Figures 20.5–20.10) are an important component of the rehabilitation programme (Donatelli 2006) for this condition as it appears to be associated with hypomobility of the upper lumbar spine from which the iliopsoas originates. Hernias Hernias of the abdominal wall must always be con- sidered in athletes with groin pain.

The true incidence of sportsman’s hernia re- mains controversial; some authors (Swan and Wolcott 2007) believe it is only an obscure cause of groin pain in athletes, although others (Meyers et al.2008) have now come to believe that it is the most common cause of chronic groin pain. The term ‘sportsman’s hernia’ is considered by many to be a misnomer as there is typically no demonstrable hernia or defect in the groin or the abdominal wall. The deﬁnition of Gilmore’s groin, therefore, could be any condition that causes persistent unilateral pain in the groin (Brannigan et al.2000), without a conventional hernia. It is probably best described as a severe musculo-tendinous injury or disruption of the groin, which can be successfully treated by surgical repair towards the restoration of normal balanced and stable anatomy.

In patients with the possibility of several different diagnoses, ultrasound can also evaluate surrounding muscles and joints.

Some studies, such as Morelli and Weaver (2005), have suggested abnormalities with the rectus abdominis insertion, avulsions of the internal oblique muscle ﬁbers at the pubic tubercle, or entrapment of the ilioinguinal or genitofemoral nerves.

Avulsion fractures Groin pain from avulsion fractures of the hip must be considered particularly in young athletes who say they experienced acute, sudden-onset, speciﬁc pain. The relative weakness of the apophysis of the ado- lescent skeleton predisposes the young athlete to a variety of avulsion fractures. Two of which are force- ful movement avulsion of the anterior inferior iliac spine by rectus femoris, and avulsion of the anterior superior iliac spine by sartorius. Treatment and rehabilitation Management for the majority of avulsion fractures (Koh and Dietz 2005) is usually by conservative rest and gradual incremental return to activity. Depend- ing on the size and amount of displacement of the fracture fragment, the injury may sometimes need surgical repair.

Treatment and rehabilitation Caught early, rest and reduced weight bearing will help, but there will usually be a longer term conse- quence requiring careful guidance and management of everyday activity as well as training in order to continue in sport. Osteitis pubis The symphysis pubis is a ﬁbrous joint between the two halves at the front of the pelvis. The adductor muscles attach either side and the abdominal muscles attach along the top of the pubic bones. Therefore the symphysis is subjected to signiﬁcant shearing forces, especially during alternate single leg weight bearing with change of direction during activities like running and kicking (Lovell et al.2006). The shearing forces can be increased by biomechanical limitations, such as restriction of internal hip rotation (Figure 20.3). Sometimes called Gracilis syndrome, this is a chronic pathology affecting the bone or cartilage of the pubic symphysis and relates to repetitive stress and resulting pain and tenderness from activities like kicking, weightlifting, running and jumping. Torsional or rotational movement stressing the pu- bic symphysis seems to particularly aggravate, and postpartum women are more susceptible (Asian and Fynes 2007), possibly due to the laxity of the pelvic ligaments during and after pregnancy."}
{"id": "1975", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Osteitis pubis causes pain in the pubic region, radiating into the medial thigh of one or both sides. The pain may be speciﬁcally in the thigh, but is often present in the lower abdominal area. There may also be associated instability at the symphysis, and the athlete may be aware of clicking in the region, often noticed when turning in bed. Commonly pain will diminish with warm up and be tolerable during activity. X-ray will sometimes demonstrate a mottled ap- pearance at the symphysis as a result of the inﬂam- matory process taking place in the joint. Standing antero-posterior and single-leg-stance pelvic radio- graphs aid in the diagnosis of pelvic instability more effectively than standard radiographs of the pelvis in supine or a standing antero-posterior radiograph of the pelvis alone (Siegel et al.2008). A bone scan usu- ally shows increased uptake in the pubic bone and MRI (Kunduracioglu et al.2007) will often show oedema in the bone. Treatment and rehabilitation Treatment of this condition is notoriously difﬁcult (Choi et al."}
{"id": "1976", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2008). A conservative approach to treat- ment of osteitis pubis is considered the ﬁrst choice of action, while warning the athlete that prolonged rest and prolonged absence from sport is likely. How- ever, the condition may take several months to re- solve, which can mean difﬁculty with the patience of athlete and coach. Pain will often respond well to anti-inﬂammatory medication initially. However, symptoms often grad- ually or suddenly become more acute with pain that inhibits or stops activity, becoming unresponsive to conservative management. Treatment and rehabilitation (Figure 20.12) should include strengthening exercises for the core and muscles around the pelvis and lumbar spine, but more importantly dealing with biomechanical inﬂu- ences like restricted movement of the hip joints and particularly rest from aggravating movement and ac- tivities (Wollin and Lovell 2006).

There is very little sound evidence for any invasive treatment in osteitis pubis other than time, management and incrementally progressive rehabil- itation. Hip labral tear The labrum is a lip of cartilage around the edge of the hip acetabulum, which serves to deepen the socket providing added stability to the joint. In jump- ing and kicking sports such as high jump and foot- ball, there are signiﬁcant repetitive stresses placed on the labrum. This cumulative stress with anterior hip impingement (Noiseux and Tanzer 2008) can re- sult indamagetothelabrum, causingpain, restriction and sometimes clicking with hip movement, particu- larly anterior impingement on combined ﬂexion and adduction, although some recent ﬁndings (Guevara et al.2006) suggest abnormal hip morphology may be a risk factor for labral tears. The athlete will usually complain of anterior hip pain which may radiate down the anterior thigh, commonly aggravated by sitting, squatting or a pro- longed hip ﬂexion position. It has been observed (Carreira et al.2006) that 72% of athletes with a labral tear reported low back pain as one of their symptoms."}

Diagnosis can be conﬁrmed on MRI and an injection of local anaesthetic into the hip area at the same time helps to conﬁrm that MRI ﬁndings are related to the symptoms. Treatment and rehabilitation There has been some limited success with tractional mobilisation of especially the anterior hip structures to relieve compression, using ‘seat-belt’ mobilisa- tion techniques that give the therapist more me- chanical advantage over the very strong hip joint. Hydrotherapy for hip stability and mobility may di- minish symptoms and is certainly prudent post op- eratively. Modiﬁcation of technique or training that directly or indirectly impinges the anterior hip is essential. Treatment in elite level athletes by arthroscopic surgery has been very successful. However, athletes who have undergone arthroscopy for labral tears will unfortunately frequently develop subsequent symp- toms associated with an early degenerative hip joint (Murphy et al.2006). Synovitis of the hip It is important to mention that synovitis may be a complication of hip pathologies. However, it may be a primary problem, especially when associated with a rheumatological condition."}

Rehabilitation exercises for the groin According to Jansen (2008) there is evidence that physical therapy aiming at strengthening (Figures 20.5 and 20.6) and coordinating the muscles stabil- ising hip and pelvis has superior results compared with passive physical therapy. Holmich et al. (1999) maintains that active rehabilitation gives the athlete over 10 times the outcome possibility of returning to active sport. The correct continually adapting bal- ance between training and competition activity and recovery is critical to maximise the performance of athletes. A number of recovery sessions and modal- ities are now used as a fundamental element of the training programmes of elite athletes to help attain this critical balance and to reduce injury potential alongside optimising performance (Barnett 2006). The pelvic mobility, control and proprioceptive stability of the athlete are important in preventing in- jury, but are also fundamental towards performance in sport. The performance beneﬁts of strength and conditioning exercises can be a useful tool of persua- sion for the therapist to convince athlete and coach of the beneﬁts of certain seemingly pedantic exercises and drills. Single leg tests and exercises can be a useful guide to the control available to the athlete in a relatively static situation as compared with expectations in the much harder and spontaneous active situation of sporting activity. These can take the form of reduced weight bearing tests and exercise in a pool (Vaile et al."}

Synovitis or inﬂammation of the hip joint is the most common cause of hip pain in children. The hip joint is far more prone to viral inﬂammation in children than in adults but fortunately is usually self-limiting with rest from sport and conservative management, and has no long- term effects. It is im- portant however to differentiate this condition from septic arthritis where a bacterial infection can de- velop in the joint, which is far more serious and necessitates treatment in hospital with intravenous antibiotics. Perthes disease Perthes disease is a disturbance in the development of the hip, with the head of the femur becoming misshapen. For reasons that are not fully under- stood, the blood supply to the hip joint sometimes becomes compromised in children. Properly called Legg-Calve-Perthes disease it typically affects one hip, but sometimes it develops in both hips. Although it can affect children of nearly any age, it is most common among boys between the ages of four and eight years (Rosenfeld et al.2007)."}
{"id": "1983", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "There are many degrees of severity, and of signiﬁ- cant relevance to sport, some mild cases even remain undetected until later in life particularly exacerbated by the more intensive physical stress of sport. If di- agnosed in childhood, sporting activities will have to be modiﬁed to minimise the chance of exacerbating the condition. In more severe cases, surgical inter- vention is indicated and sporting activity has to be signiﬁcantly managed (Kocher and Tucker 2006). Epiphysis related injury This very signiﬁcant and sometimes, especially ini- tially, undiagnosed condition occurs particularly in sport; the epiphysis at the top of the femur moving out of position (Boardman et al.2009). It affects boys more than girls, primarily between 8 and 16 years old and usually as a result of repeated cumula- tive stress, sometimes exacerbated by a fall or impact trauma. The pain may settle with rest but is normally accompanied by a limp. Less commonly a limp or odd walk may be the only abnormality present and a few children only complain of pain in the knee. This condition constitutes a medical emergency and can produce deformity in the child not diagnosed and treated promptly. One area that is commonly injured in child athletes is the attachment of Rectus Femoris to the anterior inferior iliac spine."}
{"id": "1984", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Children involved in explosive activities like sprinting, jumping and kicking are at higher risk due to excessive or repetitive loading on the origin of the quadriceps. The severity of the in- jury varies from a mild strain, where there is inﬂam- mation of the tendon attachment to avulsion, where the growth plate is pulled off the pelvis. Most of these growth plate injuries can be treated conservatively with rest, gentle very care- ful stretching and progressive and controlled func- tional strengthening (e.g. slow controlled squatting). However, if there is signiﬁcant displacement of the avulsed bony attachment, surgical reattachment is required. It is important to emphasise that problems from the hip joint can present as knee pain, particularly in children, because of their particularly sensitive somatic radiation from the hip to the knee. Treatment and rehabilitation Hydrotherapy is particularly effective with children due to the novelty element of being in water doing what would otherwise be a strain on a short attention span. Exercises are used for hip mobility, strength and stability as well as to regain conﬁdence to use the limb and progress into shallower water. Non-weight bearing exercises can be used on land, progressing to partial weight bearing with the use of crutches, and ﬁnally to full weight bearing and dynamic activity. Gait re-education is particularly important in the developing child as asymmetries that can be ad- dressed will be magniﬁed with growth and become habitual and subsequently permanent. Propriocep- tion and balance can also be inhibited by hip condi- tions in children and must also be improved as soon as possible to achieve optimum recovery."}

Other causes of groin pain Injuries to the groin that do not involve the bones or musculature are usually the result of a direct impact. Reasons to suspect these injuries are more signif- icant include blood in the urine; severe abdominal pain and tenderness, usually in the event of a blad- der injury; persistent nausea, vomiting, or abdomi- nal distension; and swelling in the femoral triangle or inguinal area, usually in the event of a hernia. All of the soft-tissue structures of the groin, especially the penis, testis, urethra and bladder are susceptible to injury. All of these symptoms merit immediate medical evaluation, preferably in a hospital. It should now be evident that musculoskeletal causes of groin pain can be difﬁcult enough to differ- entiate from each other however, we must be aware that intra-pelvic and intra-abdominal conditions can mimic musculoskeletal groin injuries. Therefore, if there are any doubts referral for abdominal exami- nation to an appropriate clinician should be part of the assessment of the athlete with groin pain. Discussion Although an athlete’s symptoms may be in the area of the groin, the subjective history and objective ex- amination in relation to the complexity of predispos- ing factors and speciﬁc sport often makes deﬁnitive diagnosis and prognosis uncertain. A recent study by Bradshaw et al (2008) showed a different break- down of injuries in a sporting population presenting with groin pain than previously reported, which in- fers there may be diagnostic difﬁculties in the groin area. The high incidence of hip pathology and the poor prognosis that this confers are worthy of note."}

Several rehabilitation principles are therefore paramount (Figure 20.11 and 20.12): r monitoring of load modiﬁcation r re-establishing efﬁcient weight transference r retraining the global muscles supporting the ‘sling’ support system r restoring joint mobility r restoring muscle extensibility r reducing adductor muscle strength deﬁcits r training sport-speciﬁc areas of strength, i.e the muscle groups predominantly used r training relevant functional movement patterns, i.e. relating to the characteristic techniques of the sport. Conservative management of athletic chronic groin injury results in an excellent outcome when assessed by the return to sport criterion. However, the results were only satisfactory if the criterion of ongoing symptoms after treatment was used. More research is needed to compare the efﬁcacy of all treatments that are used in this troublesome condi- tion (Verrall et al.2007). Treatment should certainly be centered on the underlying cause.

This perspective is clearly illustrated in Table 21.1, which summarises the basic differences in selected international clinical research groups’ ACL-reconstruction (ACL-R) rehabilitation programmes. Following ACL-R, Table 21.1 demon- strates there is currently no consensus of opinion with regard to the use of a knee brace, the type of exercise performed, the timing of when an exercise is introduced in the rehabilitation process, the use of strength tests as objective rehabilitation progression criteria, or the use of hop tests as objective outcome measures. As such, this section will provide a rig- orous evidence-based introduction to key concepts in exercise rehabilitation for ACL, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL) and menisus in- juries. For each injury, weight-bearing restrictions, knee bracing recommendations and rehabilitation strength training guidelines are presented in line with very speciﬁc rehabilitation concerns, concepts and exercise modiﬁcations unique to each injury type during the ‘early’ stages of rehabilitation (i.e. ≤12 weeks post-injury/post-surgery) when speciﬁc tissue healing time frames and the protection of surgically repaired or reconstructed injury sites may still be of signiﬁcant concern. Since ideal knee and lower limb biomechanical function for high level sports perfor- mance is then going to be the same in the ‘late’ stages of rehabilitation (i.e. ≥12 weeks to 12 months) and at the point of full return-to-function regardless of the initial type of knee injury, generic exercise rehabili- tation guidelines for all knee ligament and meniscus injuries are then presented with reference to propri- oception, neuromuscular control, balance, decelera- tion, plyometric and agility training. This means, for example, that towards the ‘late’ stages of rehabilitation it does not necessarily mat- ter whether a rugby player has sustained an in- jured ACL, PCL or lateral meniscus – if the player wishes to return to competitive rugby the knee still has to perform in a multi-directional agility-biased sport with the same frequent rapid deceleration- acceleration cycles, as well as tolerating high im- pact forces with every foot-strike when running and jumping or as a result of collisions with opponents or the ground, regardless of the initial type of knee in- jury. As such, a major premise of this chapter’s over- all rehabilitation philosophy is that range-of-motion (ROM) restrictions and rehabilitation strength Sports Rehabilitation and Injury Prevention Edited by Paul Comfort and Earle Abrahamson C⃝2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd"}

Table 21.2 shows typical knee mech- anisms of injury and common clinical diagnostic tests. Early stage rehabilitation The early rehabilitation phase following injury or surgical reconstruction of the knee ligaments or menisci is initially concerned with the resolution of inﬂammation, the reduction and removal of swelling, and regaining full activation of the inhibited mus- cles, principally the quadriceps. Use of the rest, ice, compression, elevation (RICE) principle and how it helps in the resolution of inﬂammation has been discussed elsewhere within this book. With all knee injuries it is critical that the injured structures are allowed time to recover from the trauma they have received as a result of the initial injury or as a re- sult of any surgical intervention. It is important that in all but the most minor of injuries, the patient’s level of weight-bearing during gait and functional activities in the ﬁrst 72 hours post-injury is ideally pain-free or at least causes minimal pain. The use of crutches and partial weight bearing (PWB) is of- ten critical to achieving this. In simplest terms, if the knee-injured patient presents with any antalgic gait or ‘limp’, crutches should be used for as long as is necessary to temporarily unload and protect sensitised healing tissues. Crutches should not be discontinued until a patient can demonstrate full ac- tive knee extension ROM (i.e. there is no ‘quadri- ceps lag’). Table 21.3 illustrates more injury-speciﬁc weight-bearing guidelines."}
{"id": "2019", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Minimising quadriceps inhibition and atrophy is of critical importance in the management of any knee injury, and this is covered below. Knee rehabilitation concerns and concepts There are several clinical concerns and concepts re- garding the safe and expedient rehabilitation of any knee-injured patient, especially in the initial rehabili- tation period (≤12 weeks post-injury/post-surgery). Speciﬁc questions that address these clinical con- cerns and concepts include: r How to manage quadriceps muscle atrophy and overcome its inhibition?r Should a surgical reconstruction be performed?r Should a knee brace be used during rehabilitation?r What are the rehabilitation strength training and joint loading considerations when treating the knee-injured patient?r Does a surgical reconstruction prevent knee os- teoarthrosis (OA)?Quadriceps inhibition and muscle atrophy Persistent quadriceps weakness is associated specif- ically with ACL injury (Palmieri-Smith et al.2008) but also knee injuries in general, and presents a major rehabilitation challenge for patients and clinicians alike. Quadriceps strength deﬁcits can still easily exceed 20% at 6 months after ACL-R, a time when many athletes are cleared to return to activity (Keays et al."}
{"id": "2020", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2007). The magnitude of quadriceps weakness can lessen with time, but most research suggests that quadriceps strength deﬁcits following knee joint in- jury persist for many months or years following in- jury or surgery (Shelbourne and Nitz 1990; Snyder- Mackler et al.1995; Natri et al.1996; Holder-Powell and Rutherford 1999; Risberg et al.1999b, 2007; Mikkelsen et al.2000; Feller and Webster 2003), il- lustrating the long-term nature of this problem. As the quadriceps is critical to dynamic joint stability, weakness of this muscle group is related to poor functional outcomes and may contribute to the early onset of knee OA (Palmieri-Smith et al.2008). There is evidence to suggest that arthrogenic mus- cle inhibition (AMI) and perhaps muscle atrophy are primarily responsible for the decrements in quadri- ceps strength following knee injury (Palmieri-Smith et al.2008)."}

A valgus collapse is associated with combined movements of knee ﬂexion + anterior tibial displacement + internal tibial rotation + knee valgus. Contact mechanism usually involves the pivoting (into valgus/rotation) whilst the tibia is ﬁxed Incidence can range between 0.04 and 3.07 injuries per 1,000 athlete-exposures. Females demonstrate a 3–6 times higher incidence Lachmans test Anterior draw test Pivot shift test PCL The mechanism of injury consistently involves a high-velocity and ‘high-impact’ posteriorly-directed force applied to the anterior aspect of the proximal tibia. An example would be a front-on tackle to a ﬂexed knee in rugby or American football. The combined movements of forced knee hyperﬂexion + knee varus-valgus are also common mechanisms of injury for the PCL Incidence of injury can range between 0.01 and 0.90 injuries per 1,000 athlete exposures Posterior Sag sign Reverse pivot shift Posterior draw test MCL Results from a collision with another person. Most frequently a lateral blow to the distal femur or proximal tibia whilst the foot is ﬁxed on the ground, causing a valgus torque to the knee and overstretching the ﬁbres of the MCL resulting in a partial or complete tear of the ligament substance Most commonly injured knee ligament accounting for almost 30% of all knee ligament injuries, approximately 3.1 MCL injuries per 1,000 player hours Abduction or valgus stressing of knee LCL It is quite difﬁcult to induce an isolated acute sprain, since this either requires the knee to collapse into varus in a non-contact situation, or for the knee to be forced into varus in a contact/collision situation. However, isolated acute LCL sprains do occasionally occur in collision sports as a result of a low-velocity low-impact blow from the medial or anteromedial aspect of the knee. Far more common is an LCL injury combined with simultaneous PCL or PLC knee injury due to a high-impact collision in sports Less than 2% of all knee ligament injuries even in collision sports with an incidence of less than 0.02 injuries per 1,000 player hours Adduction or varus stressing of knee Meniscal Traumatic meniscus injuries are usually non-contact in nature, involving forced valgus in weight-bearing, in turn resulting in extreme rotary compression forces through the lateral tibiofemoral joint. It appears most lateral meniscus injuries are traumatic, whereas most medial meniscus injuries appear to be degenerative (i.e. non-traumatic)."}

If clinicians can be effective in combating AMI early in the re- habilitation process, they will minimise the result- ing strength deﬁcits and diminish muscle atrophy, which should lead to a more complete more effec- tive rehabilitation, and likely will result in quicker patient recovery and return to sport. The question is how can this muscle inhibition be addressed?In order to remove AMI, it will need an alter- ation in the inhibitory processes causing it. This can be achieved by one of two strategies: altering sensory feedback that signals something is wrong with the knee, or modifying the motor drive to the muscles. Removing arthrogenic muscle inhibition: Altering sensory feedback Arthrogenic muscle inhibition can be caused by in- creased abnormal sensory activity caused by joint effusion, or by a lack of normal sensory feedback due to the loss of mechanoreceptors subsequent to an ACL or other ligamentous rupture. So, one approach to removing AMI would be blocking/modifying the sensory signals responsible for initiating the in- hibitory process. This might be achieved by remov- ing abnormal sensory stimuli, minimising pain, or sending signals to the central nervous system (CNS) that may modify any pre-synaptic pathways con- tributing to AMI. The most obvious method to reduce a joint effusion is aspiration of the joint. Though not without risks, it has been shown to be effective in signiﬁcantly reducing AMI (Fahrer et al."}
{"id": "2027", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "1988). Other modalities can also be used to reduce effusion such as compression, electrical muscle stimulation and elevation, but their effectiveness in reducing AMI is yet to be evaluated. Application of ice has been shown to decrease nerve conductance velocity and so slow the discharge of mechanoreceptors. Also following the application of ice, quadriceps activity has been found to be facilitated (Hopkins et al.2002). Hopkins et al. (2002) also found that the application of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) decreased AMI through the reduction of pre-synaptic inhibition. Stokes et al. (1985) found the effect of TENS was maximised when used whilst the patient exercised. Removing arthrogenic muscle inhibition: Improving motor drive Rather than blocking or modifying abnormal sen- sory feedback, an alternative approach to targeting AMI is to activate the inhibited motorneurons."}
{"id": "2028", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "As AMI prevents active recruitment of the quadriceps, electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) would allow for direct recruitment of motorneurons. Moreover, EMS has also been shown to preferentially activate type II muscle ﬁbres compared with voluntary training of a similar intensity (Binder-Macleod et al.1995). Research has also shown quadriceps EMS in combi- nation with active quadriceps exercise has a superior effect than exercise or EMS alone (Snyder-Mackler et al.1991). Electromyography (EMG) and other forms of biofeedback may also be a useful adjunct to active exercise in overcoming AMI. Though the evidence is limited, Maitland et al. (1999) present a case study showing positive ﬁndings. Eccentric exercises have the potential to overload the muscle in a manner greater than that of concentric exercise. Gelber et al (2000) found positive results with the addition of speciﬁc eccentric exercise programmes, and that by using a graduated programme any issue with delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) was avoided."}

However, there is no single subjective or objective predictor as to whether an ACL-D patient should or should not undergo reconstructive surgery (Herrington and Fowler 2006), and the amount of anterior knee laxity measured by anterior tibial dis- placement does not predict whether or not a patient will be able to perform high level physical activities (Clark 2001; Herrington 2004). Therefore, it seems at present the best way to decide on whether a patient should undergo ACL-R surgery is whether there are persistent repetitive episodes of giving way resulting in major functional disability. In other words, how a patient performs functionally having undergone an intensive rehabilitation period. However, if an ACL injury co-exists with a major tear of the MCL or LCL,"}

There is also substantial evidence that a pa- tient who is PCL-deﬁcient (PCL-D) can perform high-level physical activities or return to sports participation with minimal functional limitation regardless of the amount of posterior laxity present (Fontbote et al.2005; Shelbourne et al.1999). Therefore, it seems the best way to decide whether a patient should undergo PCL-reconstruction (PCL- R) surgery is whether there are persistent episodes of giving way and knee pain or swelling. Of consid- eration as to whether a PCL-R is performed is the integrity of the remaining tibiofemoral capsuloliga- mentous structures. If there is signiﬁcant post-injury laxity in any of the other main tibiofemoral ligaments (i.e. ACL, LCL, MCL) or the posterior- lateral complex (PLC) or posterior-medial complex (PMC), then a PCL-R is recommended (LaPrade and Wentorf 2002). A PCL-R is also recommended for the PCL-D knee if the injury has resulted in a bony avulsion of either of the PCL attachments (Wilk et al.1999)."}
{"id": "2031", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The MCL has a greater ability to heal than the other knee ligaments, with excellent tensile strength and overall functional outcome, even after a Grade III sprain, and its is generally now recommend that non-surgical treatment and management of acute iso- lated MCL injuries occurs (Halinen et al.2006). Even in instances where a combined MCL-ACL in- jury exists, the majority opinion is that the MCL is treated conservatively whilst an ACL-R is performed (Halinen et al.2006; Noyes and Barber-Westin 1995). Although the LCL heals more slowly than the MCL, Grade I and II LCL tears are treated con- servatively where these injuries typically present as isolated LCL trauma (Meislin 1996). Since Grade III LCL tears rarely present without combined trauma to the PLC or PCL, surgical reconstruction of the LCL and any additionally damaged adjacent cap- suloligamentous structures is recommended (Noyes and Barber-Westin 2007). Surgical repair of the menisci is often recom- mended to relieve related symptoms, restore knee kinematics to as near normal as possible, and re- store the patient’s function, although outcomes vary considerably (Brindle et al.2001). Multiple vari- ables inﬂuence the decision to carry out an operative repair including the patient’s age, health, lifestyle, willingness to undergo surgery, likely post-operative adherence with rehabilitation, and the location of a tear (Brindle et al.2001; Lee et al."}
{"id": "2032", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2002). Healing of the menisci is inﬂuenced by the degree of vas- cular penetration, with only 25–30% of the menisci outer substance possessing a viable blood supply (Brindle et al.2001). Consequently, the middle and inner thirds of the menisci substance possess a poor blood supply and are unlikely to heal easily, if at all (Brindle et al.2001). The alternative to meniscal re- pair, partial meniscectomy, frequently causes altered knee kinematics and an earlier onset of tibiofemoral OA (Lohmander et al.2007), and so meniscal re- pair is preferred wherever possible (Lee et al.2002). However, partial meniscectomy is usually performed if the tear is in the inner one-third of the meniscus substance, if the tear has major tissue fragmentation or degeneration, or for tears where the edges cannot be approximated (McLaughlin and Noyes 1993). Use of a knee brace during rehabilitation The use of a knee brace following knee joint in- jury or surgery can depend on the the type of tissue injured or the surgical procedure that has been per- formed (Table 21.3)."}

As such, there appears to be no need to use a knee brace after isolated ACL-R. In contrast to ACL injury, routine use of a knee brace after PCL injury can be essen- tial, although speciﬁc recommendations vary for the PCL-D and PCL-R knee. For the PCL-D knee which is to be managed non- operatively, recommendations can differ according to whether there is a partial or complete tear of the PCL (Margheritini et al.2002). Posterior shear forces begin to dramatically increase at approximately 60◦ knee ﬂexion during closed kinetic chain (CKC) knee exercise such as the double-leg bodyweight (BW) squat (Figure 21.1), BW wall-squat (Figure 21.2), horizontal double-leg press (Figure 21.3), dumb- bell single-leg squat (Figure 21.4), and horizontal single-leg press (Figure 21.5).

Joint loading considerations in knee rehabilitation strength training There has been a commonly held belief that open kinetic chain (OKC) exercises such as the single-leg resisted knee extension (Figure 21.6) generate ‘excessive’ anterior tibial shear forces and ACL graft tensile loads. The term ‘excessive’ refers to the concern that OKC quadriceps strength training (i.e. resisted knee extension) induces large anterior tibial shear forces which, in turn, impose large tensile forces and load on a new ACL-R that are of sufﬁcient magnitude to damage the healing graft-ﬁxation complex (Fitzgerald, 1997). Although this concern is historically grounded with the best intentions for the patient, recent research demonstrates it no longer has a solid foundation in clinical practice, and so normal lower limb OKC and CKC muscle strength levels are illustrated in Table 21.4 and Table 21.5, respectively. Between-limb differences in muscle strength should be no greater than 10% as determind Figure 21.6 Single-leg dynamic resisted knee exten- sion. Curved arrow represents how the mass of the lower leg and ankle-weight can theoretically induce more rela- tive knee joint rotation than knee joint compression.

Anterior tibial shear forces are considered rep- resentative of ACL tensile forces (Escamilla et al.1998) and vary considerably according to the type of exercise performed (Table 21.6). A resisted knee extension against a load of between 2kg and 39kg generates mean peak anterior tibial shear forces of between 50 Newtons (N) (Isaac et al.2005) and 250N (Escamilla et al.1998), which is equivalent to 200–250N generated by a BW forward step-up (Isaac et al.2005). It is also signiﬁcantly less than the 300–410N generated by just walking (Shelburne et al."}
{"id": "2042", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2004, 2005). So, based on these studies, it is difﬁcult to reconcile why many ACL-R patients are encouraged to walk and climb stairs as soon as possible post-surgery but forbidden to perform re- sisted knee extensions, since walking actually gener- ates higher anterior tibial shear forces (Table 21.6). Furthermore, as the vast majority of popular cru- ciate ligament reconstruction graft tissues fail at > 1900N (Table 21.7), and popular graft ﬁxation meth- ods for ACL-R fail at ≥500N post-surgery (Table 21.8), it is also clear that the 50–250N generated by sub-maximal resisted knee extensions are of insufﬁ- cient magnitude to damage a properly applied graft and ﬁxation method within correctly placed bone tunnels. With regard to the clinical application of OKC and CKC strength training after ACL-R, ﬁve re- search groups have studied this (Bynum et al.1995; Mikkelsen et al.2000; Morrissey et al.2000; Beynnon et al.2005; Perry et al.2005a).

These studies all demonstrate that the clinical application of resisted OKC knee extensions with ACL-injured patients does not cause an increase in knee laxity as deﬁned by anterior tibial displacement."}

As such, exercise rehabilitation for the PCL-D or PCL-R knee requires greater care and slower pro- gression than for the ACL-injured knee. This is because the normal posterior shear forces that are generated during physical activities are consistently of a greater magnitude than the lower limits of the mean ultimate load for common PCL graft ﬁxation methods approximated at 500N (Table 21.8). Conse- quently, there is a high risk of damage to the PCL-R graft ﬁxation site if exercise rehabilitation is pro- gressed too aggressively or too quickly post-surgery. As outlined earlier, six to eight weeks is considered to be a sufﬁcient period for initial ‘graft protection’ since this is the time-frame currently thought neces- sary for minimal ﬁxation site healing and soft-tissue graft incorporation to occur at the bone tunnel inter- face (Harner and Hoher 1998). With regard to OKC and CKC quadriceps strength training exercises, because posterior shear forces appear to rapidly increase beyond 500N at angles greater than 50–60◦of knee ﬂexion (Table 21.9), exercises such as, for example, resisted knee exten- sions, single-leg-press and BW wall-squats should be limited between 0–50◦knee ﬂexion."}
{"id": "2055", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "After eight weeks, knee ﬂexion ROM can be progressively in- creased in a controlled manner (Wilk et al.1999). The authors’ preferred method of cautiously increas- ing ROM during controlled strength training exer- cises following PCL-R is by 15◦knee ﬂexion per week (Table 21.3). With regard to OKC hamstring strength training exercise such as the prone hamstring curl (Figure 21.7a), some clinicians recommend complete absti- nence from such exercises for eight weeks or more after PCL-R surgery (Wilk et al.1999). This is due to the large posterior shear forces that can be generated during ‘maximum-effort’ resisted knee ﬂexion ex- ercises (Table 21.9). However, because tibiofemoral posterior shear forces do not approach 500N un- til well beyond 20–30◦knee ﬂexion during OKC resisted knee ﬂexion exercises (Toutoungi et al.2000), it is safe for the PCL-R patient to perform sub-maximal resisted isometric hamstring exercises within the limits of pain from 0–20◦knee ﬂexion (Figure 7b). This may deter progressive hamstring weakness secondary to the surgical trauma induced by harvesting the hamstring tendons."}

It is almost inevitable that any physically active young adult who sustains a signiﬁcant tibiofemoral joint injury of any kind will develop premature knee OA during their lifespan (Gelber et al.2000; Roos 2005; Lohmander et al.2007). As is the case following ACL-R, PCL-R alone does not protect the tibiofemoral joint or PFJ from the development of OA (Sekiya et al."}
{"id": "2067", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2005; Jackson et al.2008). Again, as for ACL-R, appropriate and sufﬁcient exercise rehabilitation is critical following PCL-R to induce optimal neuromuscular function in order to protect joint surfaces from excessive impact forces (Buckwalter 2003; Fontbote et al.2005). Generic knee rehabilitation concepts Basic concepts Knee and lower limb biomechanics have been extensively studied with regard to running, jumping, hopping and leaping in sports (Hewett et al.1996; Decker et al.2002; Lewek et al.2002; McLean et al.2004; Fontbote et al.2005; Noyes et al."}
{"id": "2068", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2005; Paterno et al.2007; Ortiz et al.2008). In other words, for all injured knees to perform safely and effectively in running, jumping, hopping and leaping activities without re-injury, all injured knees should eventually be able to perform the same necessary ROM and tolerate the same inherent joint compression and shear forces typical to such high- velocity high-impact movement patterns. As such, although different types of knee injury can have very different weight-bearing, ROM and rehabilitation strength training restrictions in the early stages of exercise rehabilitation (e.g. ≤12 weeks post-injury/ post-surgery) (Table 21.3), all types of knee injury should eventually be progressed to tolerate, for example, the same approximate joint compression and shear forces natural to running, jumping, hopping and leaping in sports in the late stages of rehabilitation (e.g. ≥12 weeks to 12 months post-injury/surgery). So, there are ‘generic’ knee rehabilitation concepts from early to late stage exercise rehabilitation. Effects of proximal muscles on knee function and injury Basic concepts It is well established that lumbo-pelvic-hip complex frontal plane alignment can have a powerful effect on whole lower limb alignment and, in particular, knee alignment in the frontal and transverse planes (Powers 2003). It has been identiﬁed how trunk lateral ﬂexor and gluteal muscle weakness is related to excessive knee valgus and poor frontal plane alignment during single-leg CKC tasks (Willson et al.2006; Jacobs et al.2007), whilst others have statistically proven how impaired trunk and gluteal"}

Moreover, Bobbert and Van Zandwijk (1999) have demonstrated how increased gluteal muscle function directly enhances both quadriceps and hamstring muscle function during dynamic CKC tasks. There- fore, generic exercises for all tibiofemoral joint injuries should include strength training for the trunk lateral ﬂexors, gluteus maximus, and gluteus medius. Trunk lateral flexors The trunk lateral ﬂexors have a profound effect on maintaining pelvic alignment in the frontal plane (Neumann 2002), and weakness and dysfunction in these muscle groups predicts non-contact knee in- jury (Zazulak et al.2007). An excellent exercise to speciﬁcally target these muscle groups is the isomet- ric side-bridge in standing (Figure 21.8) which can Figure 21.8 Standing isometric side-bridge.

As an exercise this can be performed using 10 repeti- tions per set for up to eight seconds each to avoid the effects of cumulative ischemia over multiple repeti- tions (McGill 2007). In testing, normal mean total holding times are ≥80 seconds for each side (McGill et al.1999). Gluteus maximus The gluteus maximus has the ability to limit exces- sive hip adduction and internal rotation of the femur (Neumann 2002), also playing a crucial role in preventing lower limb ﬂexion collapse in single-leg stance (Liu et al."}

Unilateral weakness of the gluteus maximus is linked to eventual onset of lower limb injury and low back pain (LBP) (Nadler et al.2000), and so exercises for this muscle group should also be included in all knee rehabilitation programmes. Effective exercises for the gluteus maximus include prone isometric setting (Figure 21.10) eventually progressing to straight-leg hip extension in four-point kneeling (Ekstrom et al.2007). This exercise can be performed using 10 repetitions per set for up to eight seconds each to avoid the effects of cumulative ischemia over multiple repetitions (McGill 2007).

Con- sequently, OKC training (Docherty et al.1998; Friemert et al.2006), CKC (axial loading) training (Rogol et al.1998), balance training on a wobble board (Waddington et al.1999, 2000) and plyomet- ric training (Waddington et al.2000) have all been shown to enhance peripheral joint proprioception deﬁned by reduced errors in active static JPS repositioning tasks. Neuromuscular control Definition and classification Neuromuscular control refers to any aspect of CNS control of muscle to function as a dynamic restraint and stress shield of inert tissues and with the speciﬁc aim of maintaining functional joint stability (FJS) (Riemann and Lephart 2002a, 200b). In other words, neuromuscular control is the active restraint of ex- cessive joint motion and the coordinated dampening of joint loads in response to speciﬁc sensory feed- back (Riemann and Lephart 2002a, 2002b), and can be classiﬁed into acute and learned neuromuscular control (Clark 2008). Strength training alone does not consistently modify potentially dangerous whole lower limb and local knee joint kinematics or kinetics (Herman et al."}
{"id": "2077", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2008). As such, neuromuscular control is an important concept since different exercise training methods induce the different physiological and biomechanical adaptations that comprise its separate components. This is another major premise of this chapter – different training methods induce different adaptations, and so a comprehensive injury prevention or injury rehabilitation programme must be composed of several different types of exercise in order to thoroughly encompass all the different components of neuromuscular control. Neuromuscular control can be considered as the motor component of sensorimotor control. Acute neuromuscular control Acute neuromuscular control is an almost instanta- neous motor response to ‘at-that-moment-in-time’ sensory information about sudden joint displace- ments, and is composed of the electromechanical delay (EMD), and the rate-of-force development (RFD). The EMD is the timeframe between the onset of reﬂex muscle electrical activity and the onset of measurable force development (Winter and Brooks 1991). The RFD is the timeframe between the onset of measurable force development and the achievement of a speciﬁc quantity of force (e.g. 25% 1RM) (Kaneko et al.2002). Relatively shorter EMD and RFD timeframes equate to faster reactive muscle activity which is clearly desirable when resisting sudden potentially dangerous knee joint displacements. To date, there is no convincing evidence that the EMD can be shortened with training, whereas the knee muscle RFD can be signiﬁcantly shortened with OKC and CKC strength training (Hakkinen and Komi 1983, 1986; Hakkinen et al."}
{"id": "2078", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "1998; Aagaard et al.2002; Bruhn et al.2004), as well as balance training (Bruhn et al.2004; Gruber and Gollhofer 2004; Ihara and Nakayama 1986), and agility training (Wojtys and Huston 1996). Therefore, a selection of different training methods can enhance knee acute neuromuscular control in the form of faster reactive muscle activity. Learned neuromuscular control Where acute neuromuscular control refers to reac- tive muscle activity at a single point-in-time, learned neuromuscular control refers to how the CNS uses repeated sensory feedback generated within mul- tiple training sessions to induce long-term training adaptations that includes joint-protective motor pro- grammes and more favourable knee and lower limb kinematics and kinetics. Learned neuromuscular control includes decreased vertical ground reaction force (VGRF), decreased knee joint reaction force (JRF), decreased knee joint shear forces, decreased knee abduction (valgus) forces, improved frontal plane hip-knee-ankle alignment, increased hip- knee-ankle ﬂexion, improved hamstring:quadriceps (H:Q) ratios, improved feed-forward pre-impact muscle activation, and improved postural stability. All of these components contribute to improved whole lower limb alignment and decreased knee joint forces during highly dynamic tasks, and so are highly desirable for knee injury prevention and rehabilitation programmes. Increased VGRF during the loading response phase of landing tasks results in increased"}

This offers the potential for both ACL and tibiofemoral articular surface injury. Balance, de- celeration (landing) and plyometric training have all been shown to reduce the VGRF during athletic tasks (Hewett et al.1996; Cowling et al.2003; Myer et al.2006a), and so are essential training methods for reducing knee joint shear and compression forces. Increased knee abduction forces during landing tasks co-exist with increased valgus hip-knee-ankle frontal plane alignment and reduced hip-knee-ankle saggital plane ﬂexion (Hewett et al.1996, 2005; Noyes et al."}

Open kinetic chain and CKC strength training, bal- ance training, deceleration training and plyometric training all show the ability to reduce knee abduc- tion forces, improve whole lower limb frontal plane alignment, and increase whole lower limb saggital plane ﬂexion excursion (Hewett et al.1996; Myer et al.2005, 2006b, 2007; Noyes et al.2005), thereby reducing potentially dangerous forces imposed on the ACL, MCL, lateral meniscus, and tibiofemoral joint articular surfaces. Poor postural stability (i.e. balance) has been im- plicated in non-contact knee injury because of its detrimental effects on whole lower limb alignment and local knee valgus (Hewett et al.2005; Myer et al.2006a). Closed kinetic chain strength training, bal- ance board training, deceleration training, and plyo- metric training have been proven to enhance postural stability during balance tasks (Myer et al.2006a), and so are also considered critical to a knee injury prevention and rehabilitation programme."}
{"id": "2081", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Summary Based on the studies just cited, and as for acute neu- romuscular control, many different training meth- ods result in different training adaptations associ- ated with favourable learned neuromuscular control of the knee. Therefore, comprehensive knee injury prevention and rehabilitation programmes should ideally include all of the training methods just dis- cussed either in a single training session or certainly within a weekly periodised training plan (Myer et al. Warm-up + dynamic stretches Plyometrics Deceleration drills Balance drills Closed kinetic chain strength training Open kinetic chain strength training No-impact cardiovascular training + aerobic cool-down Isolated trunk muscle exercises Passive stretches Figure 21.12 End-stage rehabilitation single training session outline.2005, 2006a, 2006b, 2007). An example of an ‘end- stage’ single-session knee rehabilitation programme sequence of exercises is presented in Figure 21.12, with exercise order moving from most complex to least complex in order to minimise the effects of fatigue (Fleck and Kraemer 1997). Between-sex differences There is no doubt that female athletes experience a greater relative number of knee injuries than males (Agel et al.2005). This is also the case for low back pain (LBP) and foot, ankle and lower leg injuries (Strowbridge 2002, 2005). Compared to males, females demonstrate less knee muscle strength and less proprioceptive acuity (Rozzi et al.1999; Lephart et al."}

In an injury prevention context, most of the neu- romuscular control variables just described can be signiﬁcantly improved with different exercise meth- ods that include strength training, balance train- ing, deceleration training and plyometric training"}

In an injury rehabilitation context, even though fe- males consistently demonstrate greater impairment in proprioception and neuromuscular control vari- ables than males, the principles underlying female exercise rehabilitation progression can essentially be the same as for males. However, comparatively speaking, since females may well be starting their knee exercise rehabilitation at a relatively ‘lower’ proprioception and neuromuscular control ‘baseline’ than males, female knee rehabilitation and return to full function may then take longer than the time re- quired for males. Proposed knee exercise rehabilitation pathway The existence of a knee exercise rehabilitation pathway (Figure 21.13) where rehabilitation is progressed in such a way that the complexity of exercise is progressed once a sufﬁcient strength training base has been established would appear possible especially since many different training methods induce different favourable proprioception and neuromuscular control training adaptations (Clark, 2008)."}
{"id": "2084", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The rationale for focussing on iso- lated (OKC) and functional (CKC) muscle strength prior to the implementation of more dynamic exercise rehabilitation methods relates to ensuring injured tissues are able to ﬁrst tolerate the higher tensile and compressive loads associated with more dynamic and impact exercises (Clark 2001, 2004) as well as correcting between-limb and within-limb compensations and facilitating the most desirable joint kinematics associated with enhanced force absorption during the loading response phase of walking, running, hopping and jumping gait (i.e. increased saggital plane knee ﬂexion). The authors present a ‘multi-modal’ knee exer- cise rehabilitation pathway (Clark, 2008) that has been employed with consistent success for more than seven years with recreational and professional ath- letes as well as frontline military operatives. The driving principle of this pathway is that patients do not progress from one exercise type to another un- til speciﬁc clinical criteria are achieved as goals of treatment. These criteria will be outlined in more detail later. Such conditions ensure the patient is progressed through rehabilitation as safely and effectively as possible according to their own unique individual ability, and so goals of treatment also function as progression-criteria (Clark 2004, 2008). When im- plementing the pathway in Figure 21.13, it is impor- tant to remember that as the patient progresses and a new exercise type is added to a single training ses- sion, each new exercise type ‘builds’ on the type that preceded it, so that the patient is always perform- ing all the previous exercise types for the remaining rehabilitation process. Balance and perturbation training Basic concepts For the purposes of this chapter, balance training refers to single-leg CKC training performed on ex- ercise devices that function as an unstable base-of- support (BOS). Such devices include, for example, rocker-boards (Figure 21.14), wobble-boards, foam rollers, inﬂatable equipment (Figure 21.15) and mini trampolines, although the clinician can obviously use any other method deemed useful for to creating an unstable BOS. The patient should be encouraged to maintain optimal pelvis-hip-knee-ankle alignment during balance training (Figure 21.15). The authors cue patients to this effect by instructing in keeping the anterior superior iliac spines (ASIS) as level as possible, and to keep the tibial tuberosity inbetween the ﬁrst and third toes, at no time should the tibial tubercle deviate inside the ﬁrst toe indicating valgus collapse of the knee and whole lower limb (Figure 21.15)."}
{"id": "2085", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Perturbation training refers to orchestrated train- ing situations where the clinician attempts to deliber- ately unbalance the patient by rhythmically tapping and knocking the balance device itself, pushing and pulling the patient at the shoulder or pelvic girdles (i.e. rhythmic stabilisations), or by distracting the patient with ball tosses (Figure 21.16). Since this type of training does not include impact forces, it seems sensible to become proﬁcient in this method of training before introducing high-impact exercise drills (e.g. plyometrics)."}

Deceleration training Basic concepts Deceleration training refers to exercise drills intended to teach correct landing technique for running, jumping, hopping and leaping activities in sports and high-level occupational tasks. Such training uses exercises designed to decelerate the momentum of the lower limb and trunk fol- lowing foot-strike and the onset of impact forces emphasising eccentric-biased muscle control of saggital plane knee and lower limb joint ﬂexion, followed by isometric-biased muscle activity to stabilise the knee, lower limb and trunk with optimal frontal and transverse plane pelvis-hip- knee-ankle alignment. As such, the sequence of muscle activity is eccentric to isometric – there is no consecutive concentric propulsion phase. Clinically, such eccentric-biased drills are applied to RSI (%) = weight pushed (kg) ÷ bodyweight (kg)×100 Figure 21.17 Calculation of the relative strength index (RSI) dampen and shock-absorb high tensile and impact (compressive) forces away from joints by reducing the VGRF. In simplest terms, deceleration training is preparation for plyometric training, and always precedes the introduction of any new plyometric drill so that patients can ﬁrst master correct landing technique. Entry criteria Since deceleration training involves high shear forces as well as high VGRF, ideal entry criteria are modiﬁed from Clark (2001, 2004, 2006), and include the normal muscle strength values outlined in Table 21.4 and Table 21.5 and Figure 21.17 and Figure 21.18, all of the trunk and gluteal muscle function recommendations described earlier in this chapter, as well as three sets of 15 repetitions of a single-leg squat to ≥45◦knee ﬂexion on a round-base balance device. At ﬁrst glance this may seem like a high number of criteria, however many of these should already have been achieved much earlier in the rehabilitation process, and such criteria are necessary to ensure as safe and effective introduction as possible of the high joint shear and compression forces inherent in high-impact training."}

Patients are initially taught the biomechanically cor- rect and functionally stable ﬁnal landing alignment where the head is up and eyes looking forwards, the trunk is inclined forwards approximately 30◦, shoulders are over the knees, knees are over the mid- to rear-foot, and hands are in the ‘athletic ready’ position (Figure 21.19), whilst in the frontal plane the centre of the hip, knee and ankle joints are"}

Following landing, it is entirely normal to demonstrate a degree of knee varus-valgus oscilla- tion (i.e. ‘wobbling’). The key concept is to control how much varus–valgus oscillation occurs (Clark 2006). This can be achieved by again verbally cue- ing the patient not to allow the tibial tubercle to deviate inside the ﬁrst toe/metatarsal. Alignment for single-leg deceleration drills should not differ greatly from that for double-leg drills, although the trunk and pelvis must move slightly laterally to the foot to maintain the body’s centre-of-mass over its BOS, the foot.

The clinician should frequently observe the patient from both the front and the side to ensure correct landing technique. Once the eccentric phase has been completed, patients should maintain the ideal landing position (Figure 21.19 and 21.20) for three to ﬁve seconds. If the patient loses balance, the ideal landing position should be reassumed for three to ﬁve seconds to pro- vide the CNS with a ‘memory’ of the correct versus incorrect ﬁnal position. The intensity of a deceler- ation drill can be inﬂuenced by increasing distance or height covered, with a recommended 80–100 to- tal foot-contacts per training session for an uninjured beginner (Chu 1998) and 40–50 foot-contacts for ini- tial injury rehabilitation. A within-session work:rest ratio of 1:5–1:10 is advised, and there should be no more than three training sessions per week, sepa- rated by at least 48 hours between each session (Chu 1998). Signs of fatigue include loss of ideal frontal plane alignment, decreased saggital plane joint ﬂex- ion, increased frequency of loss-of-balance, muscle tremor, and louder landings, at which point the drills should be stopped due to risk of new or re-injury. The clinician should be extremely vigilant for symptoms of pain and signs of swelling, redness or heat, which all signal that deceleration training should be ter- minated immediately pending reassessment of the patient’s injury site. Goals of treatment and objective progression-criteria The minimal goal of treatment for this type of train- ing should be to perform three sets of 10–15 repe- titions of single-leg drills on both legs with correct technique before progressing to plyometric training. It is possible for a skilful patient to achieve this goal within one training session."}
{"id": "2095", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Plyometrictraining Basic concepts Plyometric training is a progression from decelera- tion training, and involves the ballistic three-phase stretch-shortening cycle of eccentric-isometric- concentric muscle actions (Chu 1998). The isomet- ric muscle action is the transition phase between the eccentric and concentric phase, being termed the ‘amortisation phase’, and this phase should be as short as possible in order to avoid the elastic en- ergy stored within the muscle’s connective tissues being lost as heat (Chu 1998). Historically, plyomet- ric training has been classiﬁed using an ascending system of intensity from least intense to most intense including jumps/hop-in-place, standing jumps/hops, multiple jumps/hops, bounding, box drills and ﬁ- nally depth jumps (Chu 1998). Although this classi- ﬁcation system has been used for decades with un- injured athletes in a performance enhancement and injury prevention context (Chu 1998; Hewett et al.1996, 1999), it is built from empirical observations rather than quantiﬁable forces (e.g. VGRF) (Clark 2006), and is difﬁcult to transfer to an injury re- habilitation context since the ascension through the different classes of plyometric drill can be quite sud- den with regard to the anticipated dramatic increase in VGRF and tissue loads (Clark 2006). In view of this clinical concern, Clark (2006) proposed a different classiﬁcation and progression of plyometric drills termed ‘Clinical Plyometrics’ (Figure 21.21) for more reﬁned clinical application in an injury rehabilitation context. The ascending complexity of clinical plyometrics drills was based simply on a best rank ordering of joint shear forces (Table 21.10) and VGRF (Table 21.11) drawn from a wide variety of published research – the higher the forces the more intense the drill with regard to the magnitude of tissue loads (Clark 2006), as well as the notion that some types of drill naturally generate higher knee abduction forces (valgus moments) than others (Sell et al.2006). Thus, the rank ordering of drills (Figure 21.21) was based on the anticipated tissue loading characteristics of a speciﬁc drill deﬁned by the magnitude of shear and compression forces as well as knee valgus moments (Clark, 2006). This is because, for example, increased VGRF results in increased knee joint shear forces (McNair and Marshall 1994; Yu et al."}

Form skipping involves typical low- impact drills usually employed for practicing run- ning mechanics and technique (e.g. skipping high knee lift), and is a means of reintroducing running- like movements with low impact forces (Johnson et al.2005). Frontal plane drills introduce larger mediolateral loads, varus-valgus forces, VGRF, and anterior tibial shear forces than saggital plane drills (Sell et al.2006), and so also potentially increase tensile forces on the cruciate and collateral ligaments (Clark 2006). Examples of frontal plane drills are side-to-side jumps and hops. Once frontal plane drills have safely been completed, saggital plane running (jogging) can be undertaken over relatively short distances. Running in itself, even at low speeds, is a plyometric activity that induces joint shear forces (Table 21.10) and VGRF (Table 21.11). Consequently, it is clinically judicious to only introduce running after some other form of decel- eration and plyometric training has been performed ﬁrst in order to prepare the patient’s tissues and sensorimotor control systems, since running can be relatively ‘uncontrolled’ compared to structured deceleration and plyometric drills (Clark 2006). Oblique plane drills introduce greater torsion forces through the knee, although they are relatively low amplitude rotational loads compared to other plyometric drills (Clark 2006)."}

{"id": "2103", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "AGILITY-BIASED RUNNING DRILLS 439 Transverse plane drills introduce relatively high amplitude rotational loads and so are potentially very dangerous for the knee ligaments and menisci (Clark 2006). Examples of transverse plane drills are 180◦and 360◦on-the-spot spinning jumps and hops. These are some of the most dangerous single- leg hopping drills since there is a major risk of knee and lower limb high velocity varus–valgus collapse if the patient is not extremely cautious and proﬁcient in their performance. Depth jumps and hops induce some of the largest joint shear forces and VGRF (Table 21.10 and 21.11), and so these are also high risk drills which the patient must perform with meticulous technique in order to minimise the risk of re-injury (Clark 2006). Examples of depth-hops are single-leg drop-landing drills from a 40cm high box. Entry criteria Entry criteria for clinical plyometrics can be the same as for deceleration training, along with the successful completion of three sets of 10–15 repetitions of the chosen plyometric drill as a deceleration drill ﬁrst – in other words, the patient emphasises mastering the drill’s landing phase alone before converting it to a plyometric drill. Methods The methods described for deceleration training un- derpin the safe and effective execution of clinical plyometrics. Clinical plyometrics differ from decel- eration drills in that after the eccentric-isometric muscle action sequence, a concentric propulsive phase is added, and as such the patient is encour- aged to take-off as fast as possible after the landing (Clark 2006). Verbal cues used to teach the patient a rapid take-off include “tough ‘n’ go”, “quick feet”, and “fast feet” (Chu 1998). Clinical plyometrics in- tensity, within-session work:rest ratio, weekly fre- quency, and between-session rest duration are identi- cal to those for deceleration training."}

Goals of treatment and objective progression criteria A speciﬁc goal of treatment is three sets of 10 to 15 repetitions of single-leg drills on both legs with correct technique. It is important to recognise, of course, that it is not necessary for all patients to progress through clinical plyometrics to depth- jumps/drop-jumps (Figure 21.21). For example, a marathon runner might only need to progress to frontal plane drills to be conﬁdent that saggital plane-biased long-duration running can be safely undertaken, whereas a rugby player should deﬁnitely progress to transverse plane drills, and a basket ball player should certainly progress to drop-jumps. For multi-directional agility-biased games players, three sets of 10 to 15 repetitions of single-leg transverse plane drills on both legs is recommended before implementing sport-speciﬁc agility-biased running drills. Agility-biased running drills Basic concepts Agility-biased running drills’ (e.g. Figure 8’s, T run) main purpose is simply to integrate single-leg clini- cal plyometric training into functional running tasks demanding the cyclical alternation between legs (Clark 2006). Running tasks obviously involve the use of both legs, and so between-limb compensation and cheating is easily accomplished. Therefore, the clinician can only be conﬁdent that approximately equal use of both legs is being made during multi- directional running tasks if the patient has success- fully completed single-leg clinical plyometric drills ﬁrst. Entry criteria Entry criteria for sport-speciﬁc agility-biased run- ning drills are the same as for deceleration training and clinical plyometrics, with the addition of the suc- cessful completion of three sets of 10–15 repetitions of single-leg transverse plane drills on both legs. Goals of treatment and objective progression -criteria Ideal goals of treatment for this type of training are simply the successful execution of timed agility tests speciﬁc to the athlete’s sport within the drills’ normal timed standard."}

Prior to this, best clinical practice recommends the administration of the hop functional performance test (FPT) to gather objective outcome measurement data (Clark 2001; Fitzgerald et al.2001). Functional performance tests Basic concepts Outcome measurement in sports rehabilitation is di- rected at identifying an athlete’s ability to tolerate the physical demands inherent in sport-speciﬁc ac- tivity and prevent re-injury on return-to-competition (Clark 2001). The FPT recreates the knee shear, compression and torsion forces encountered dur- ing sport-speciﬁc activity under controlled clinical conditions, its use becoming increasingly popular since traditional clinical outcome measures such as knee joint laxity and isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength demonstrate weak to moderate and often insigniﬁcant relationships with functional tasks such as running and jumping (Clark 2001; Fitzgerald et al.2001). Functional performance tests include hop, leap, and jump tests and all may be administered to an athlete following knee ligament injury (Clark 2001). In fact, the administration of an FPT to a knee-injured patient is considered essential before deciding if discharge is appropriate, and so many clinical and research groups employ FPTs as objec- tive outcome measures (Table 21.1). The hop FPT simultaneously measures joint laxity/mobility, muscle extensibility, muscle strength and power, proprioception, neuromuscular control, dynamic balance, agility, pain, and athlete- conﬁdence, and so represents a ‘cumulative effect’ since it is unable to identify impairments in single physical variables (Clark 2001). However, the hop FPT is still a useful measurement tool for the clinician because it is a quantitative measure utilised to deﬁne function or outcome, it simulates the forces encountered during sport-speciﬁc activity under con- trolled clinical conditions, indirectly assesses the ex- tent to which pain inhibits the execution of functional tasks and the ability of previously injured tissues to safely absorb force, quantiﬁes between-limb dif- ferences that may predispose re-injury and assesses progress within rehabilitation, provides psycholog- ical reassurance to the patient, and correlates with subjective assessment of knee function (Clark 2001; Fitzgerald et al."}
{"id": "2107", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "2001). Therefore, hop FPTs gener- ate valuable information for the clinician regarding a knee-injured athlete’s physical and psychological status. Entry criteria When employing a hop FPT for clinical decision making with regard to potential patient discharge, a great deal of exercise rehabilitation will already have been completed. Since hop FPTs are essentially plyometric in nature (Clark 2001), in order to decide if it is ﬁrst safe to administer an FPT to a knee- injured patient, FPT entry criteria are the same as for clinical plyometrics, and include the successful completion of single-leg clinical plyometric drills. Methods With regard to choice of FPT, there is good evi- dence that multi-directional hop FPTs such as the adapted crossover hop for distance (Figure 21.22) as presented by Clark et al. (2002) are more sensitive to detecting between-limb differences in knee FJS than uni-directional FPTs such as the single hop- for-distance (Clark 2001; Noyes et al.1991). This is because multi-directional hop FPTs are considered to be most challenging for patients since they impose frontal and transverse plane forces on the knee in ad- dition to the saggital plane-biased forces generated by most horizontal hop FPTs (Clark 2001, 2002). Discharge criteria A mean LSI ≥90% (Figure 21.18) is well estab- lished as the normal value for hop testing (Daniel et al.1982; Ostenberg et al."}
{"id": "2108", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "1998). Moreover, a mean LSI ≥90% is consistently demonstrated fol- lowing multi-directional hop tests in asymptomatic ligament-injured knees where patients are regularly participating in high-level sports or occupational ac- tivities without functional limitation (Eastlack et al.1999; Hopper et al.2002). As such, assuming the uninjured limb is achieving normal values, an LSI ≥90% can be considered an ideal discharge criteria providing that all hop FPT entry criteria as described previously are also fulﬁlled."}

The cate- gory of conditions placed within the grouping AKP could be deﬁned as involving pain, inﬂammation, muscle imbalance and/or instability of any compo- nent of the extensor mechanism of the knee. This disturbance of the extensor mechanism of the knee has been regarded as one of the commonest disorders of the knee affecting between 5–15% of all patients reporting for treatment (Devereaux and Lachmann 1984; Kannus et al.1987; Milgrom et al.1991). Once present it frequently becomes a chronic problem forcing the patient to stop sport and other activities. Differential diagnosis The classiﬁcation of symptoms into AKP is con- fusing with AKP being present in many clini- cal conditions. The commonest clinical conditions which have symptoms of AKP are; patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), patella tendonopathy, fat pad syndrome, traction apophysitis (Osgood Schlat- ters/Sinding Larsen Johansson disease), plica syn- drome, iliotibial band friction syndrome (ITBS) and nerve entrapment."}

The list above highlights that alongside the ma- jor causes of AKP a number of others occur with some regularity and so are worth discussing brieﬂy here. A common cause of AKP in adolescences is traction apophysitis (Osgood Schlatters/Sinding Larsen Johansson disease). These two conditions oc- cur when excessive loading has been placed through the growth plates at the tibial tubercle in the case of Osgood Schlatters disease and the inferior pole of the patella (Sinding Larsen Johansson disease); this results in inﬂammation and pain. In both cases the patients have usually recently undergone or in the middle of a growth spurt. The pain is activity re- lated, often showing a linear relationship; the greater the activity the greater the pain, pain is localised to the respective growth plates and they a very painful on palpation. Treatment here is simply to reduce the level of loading on these tissues to one which the patient can tolerate and then gradually re-introduce loading to the tissues over a period which may ex- tend into a number of months. Secondary factors such as soft tissue length and muscle strength imbal- ances may also need addressing (see the treatment section). The entrapment of two peripheral nerves has been reported as potential causes of AKP within the liter- ature, these are the lateral cutaneous nerve and the infra-patella branch of the saphenous nerve. Prob- lems with the lateral cutaneous nerve are often mis- taken for ITBS as the pain is on the lateral side of the knee often following the course of the Iliotibial band."}

Injury to this nerve is most often associated with trauma, or through surgery (ACL or arthroscopy) damaging or irritating the nerve.

This is es- pecially the case if the patient reports having pain in any of those areas or if the patient reports the pain “going up from the knee or coming down to the knee”. Along with if the patient reports numbness or altered sensation in and around the knee anterior, medial or lateral thigh. Causes of altered loading In the above discussion we have seen that numerous structures could become injured and cause AKP. Re- gardless of the particular structure which becomes injured there is one feature common to all these in- juries, the injury itself is caused by a overloading of the tissue concerned, which is either acute and usu- ally traumatic in nature or chronic (long-term) low loads that eventually cause the tissue to break down – a “dripping tap effect”. The categories of potential causes of tissue stress are: r abnormal biomechanics r shortened soft tissue r muscle imbalances and strength deﬁcits r training/environmental. Abnormal biomechanics Understanding of the Q angle (Figure 21.23) and its effect on patellofemoral joint (PFJ) loading is crucial to the understanding of how abnormal biomechanics affects the PFJ. The Q or quadriceps angle represents the force vector (direction of pull) of the quadriceps during their contraction, if during contraction the quadriceps causes the patella to be drawn medially or laterally from its normal course this will poten- tially increase the stress and loading of the PFJ and the structures associated with it. Decreasing the Q angle by 10◦signiﬁcantly reduces load on the lateral structures of the PFJ (Elias et al.2004)."}
{"id": "2115", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The Q an- gle can be affected by both soft tissue tightness and muscle weakness which will be discussed later; it can also be effect by mal-alignment within the lower limb such as anteriorly rotated pelvis or pronation of the foot.

Anterior pelvic rotation causes one leg to appear longer and the body must compensate for this. Typically one way it com- pensates is to overly ﬂatten (pronates the foot of the longer leg) in an attempt to shorten it, thus changing Q angle. Shortened soft tissues A variety of shortened soft tissues can inﬂuence Q angle. At the hip shortened hip ﬂexors (rectus femoris, iliopsoas and ITB) can cause the pelvis to be held in an anteriorly rotated position. If the ad- ductor (groin) muscles are short; principally adduc- tor longus, this will cause the femur to be held in an internal rotated and adducted position, increasing the Q angle. A short ITB through its attachment onto the tibia can cause the tibia to be held in an externally rotated position moving the tibial tubercle laterally so changing Q angle. If the gastrocnemius or soleus (triceps surae complex) are short this limits the abil- ity to dorsi-ﬂex at the ankle, in order to still allow full movement the foot will compensate for this lack of movement by pronating excessively."}
{"id": "2116", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "444 THE KNEE Muscle imbalances and strength deficits In the research into AKP considerable attention has been paid to achieving increased activity and strength in the vastus medialis oblique (VMO) mus- cle with the aim of drawing the patella medially against the pull of the laterally attached vastus lat- eralis. The problem is the majority of the literature has failed to ﬁnd either problems with VMO in pa- tients with AKP or a means of speciﬁcally training VMO in isolation (Herrington et al.2006). What is consistent in the literature is that patients with AKP have weak quadriceps as a whole (Witvrouw et al.2002) with a number of studies showing success- ful resolution of symptoms upon strengthening of the quadriceps (Witvrouw et al.2002; Herrington and Al-Shehri 2007). A second group of muscles whose weakness is consistently reported within the literature to be associated with AKP are the gluteal muscles (gluteus maximus, medius and minimus) (Mascal et al.2003). Weakness of these muscles causes the thigh to drop into a more adducted and internal rotated position during weight bearing, this increases the Q angle and so loading on the PFJ (Figure 21.24). Training or environmental triggers All of the above problems can be found in many members of the public and yet they do not have AKP, what these predisposing factors need is a trigger that effects the tissue in a negative way reducing its tol- erance to loading."}
{"id": "2117", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "There are many potential triggers to this change in tissue load tolerance. One example would be direct trauma from a blow or surgery. An- other example would the change in loading brought about by new training shoes or boots, or a change of training surface. A further example is a too rapid increase in loading following a period of de-training (decreased loading of the tissues, so loss of toler- ance) caused by illness or even holiday. Treatment The aims of treatment are: r Relief of pain r Control of lower limb rotation Figure 21.24 Poor rotation control during squatting and landing.r Strengthening of quadriceps r Stretching of shortened soft tissues Relief of pain Taping of the patella (Figures 21.25a and 21.25b) has consistently been shown to relieve pain (see Ami- naka and Gribble (2005) for review). The mechanism by which taping brings about the relief of pain has often been questioned, but it would appear to bring about enough of a change in local tissue loading to alter tissue homeostasis (Dye 2005). Figure 21.25a shows taping of the patella medially, to change load- ing on the medial and lateral sides of the PFJ, Figure 21.25b shows an alternate method taping the patella to correct the lateral tilt. Figure 21.25c shows the taping used to relieve loading on the infra-patella fat pad. Relief of pain could also be achieved through the use of joint mobilisation."}

Both the studies of Witvrouw et al. (2002) and Herrington and Al-Shehri (2007) brought about signiﬁcant improvement in function and relief of pain within 6–8 weeks of starting the strengthen- ing programme, the signiﬁcant feature of both these programmes was the constant reassessment and ad- justment of load on the quadriceps, not necessarily the speciﬁcs of the exercise programme. A number of studies (Jonasson and Alfredson 2005 being the most recent) have noted a speciﬁc and highly useful variation on the squat exercise for patients with patella tendonopathy, this is the incline squat (Figure 21.27). This exercise would initially be done bilaterally and then the patient would be progressed to unilateral squatting as pain permitted. Figure 21.28 Extension control squat. In a similar vein, because of the lack of control in the ﬁnal degrees of extension in patients with fat pad syndrome, the squat exercise can be modiﬁed to improve control of extension as shown in Figure 21.28.

Summary Knee joint exercise rehabilitation can be a complex and controversial task with regard to weight- bearing and ROM restrictions, tissue biomechanics, between-limb and within-limb compensations, evidence-based progression-criteria, the restoration of normal gait, and therapists’ and surgeons’ opinions regarding a speciﬁc injury type. This chap- ter has presented a comprehensive, meticulously clinically reasoned and evidence-based approach to the rehabilitation of different types of knee ligament and meniscus injury or surgery, including normative data for different testing procedures to be used as goals of treatment and objective progression-criteria. The use of such data frees the clinician from the uncertainty associated with tissue healing timeframes, and outdated personal opinions frequently expressed by colleagues, by accounting for the individual patient’s ability and unique physiological status. It is the safest and most effective way to administer exercise rehabilitation for tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joint injury.

Volleyball reports ankle injuries as 44% (Agel et al.2007b), basketball 25% (Agel, Olsen et al.2007a) and soccer 23% (Nelson et al.2007) of all injuries. The lateral ligaments are primarily implicated in these injuries with the anterior tibioﬁbular ligament (ATFL) being particularly susceptible to damage. Woods et al. (2003) reported that 73% of ankle injuries in English football involved ATFL trauma. Moreover, sprains to the lateral ligaments of the ankle are responsible for more time lost from sports participation than any other injury (Hertel 2006)."}

This chapter will begin by giving a brief outline of the anatomy and biomechanics of the sporting ankle before discussing in greater detail clinical assessment and rehabilitation principles of ankle injuries. We will look at acute ankle sprains and chronic ankle instability as well as some of the other pathologies that are found in the region. Functional anatomy and biomechanics of the sporting ankle Functionally, the ankle complex is composed of three joints (Figures 22.1 and 22.2): 1.the talo-crual joint (TCJ – between the talus and the inferior aspect of the tibia) 2.the inferior tibioﬁbular joint (ITFJ – between the distal ends of the tibia and the ﬁbula) 3.the subtalar joint (STJ – between the talus and the calcaneus). Whilst it is certainly possible to damage one of these joints in isolation and it is true to say that the TCJ is implicated in the majority of lateral ankle sprains (Hertel 2002), concomitant STJ sprains may be present in as many as 80% of people presenting to sports medicine clinics with a lateral ankle sprain (Meyer et al.1986). This behoves us to become adept at assessing all the structures in the ankle."}

The ankle is least stable in plantarﬂexion (the loose packed position) and so it comes as no sur- prise that this is the position most widely implicated in acute ankle injuries. There are several ligaments that provide support to the ankle complex. The major ones are listed in Table 22.1 and illustrated in Figures 22.3 and 22.4. Dynamic stability of the ankle complex is pro- vided by the peroneal muscle group, in particular the peroneus brevis and longus. The action of these muscles has been shown to be anticipatory, preparing the ankle to accept body weight at foot strike (Kon- radsen and Hojsgaard 1993). In fact, it is the loss of the pre-emptive function of the peroneals that is thought to be one of the sequelae of CAI, leading to the foot accepting load in a more plantarﬂexed and inverted position. The load-to-failure point of the peroneal tendons is thought to be greater than that of the ATFL and equal to the CFL (Attarian et al.1985)."}

The most commonly reported method of spraining the lateral ligaments is when the ankle is “rolled” into plan- tarﬂexion and inversion (Wolfe et al.2001). This is a common occurrence in sport such as when landing from a jump onto an opponent’s shoe in basketball or when reaching for a wide backhand volley in tennis. In these situations, forefoot contact often precedes calcaneal contact, leading to a plantarﬂexion mo- ment on the talus, thrusting its narrow body between the malleoli, and exposing the lateral ligaments to a stretching force that may exceed its tensile strength (Ritchie 2001). Whilst it is possible to sustain an isolated CFL injury, it is infrequent. It may occur in an incident that involves inversion in dorsiﬂex- ion or external rotation when fully weight bearing. This mechanism may also injure the syndesmosis or the talar dome. A combined ATFL and CFL in- jury is said to occur in 20% of ankle sprain cases (Brostrom 1964)."}

It is also possible to injure the deltoid ligament on the medial side of the ankle when the weight of the body is forced over an everted foot. Given the high forces that are required to do this however, the injury is infrequent and a lateral malleolus fracture or syndesmosis injury should be excluded in this instance. Onset of pain The most important thing to exclude in an acute an- kle injury is the presence of a fracture. It is for this reason that the Ottawa Ankle Rules were formed (see below). It is possible for an athlete to sustain an ankle ligament sprain and not notice it at the time (particularly in a combat or collision sport where there may be a strong stress-induced analgesia re- sponse) although it is more common for any injury to be accompanied by immediate pain."}
{"id": "2214", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "An ankle fracture will almost invariably not allow the athlete to put any weight on it at all whereas a sprain may allow weight bearing but may get worse as it is con- tinued. The athlete may recall a ‘pop’ or a ‘crack’ at the time of injury but not too much importance should be placed on these sensations, as they do not necessarily relate to the extent of injury. Area of pain Determining the area of pain can be particularly help- ful when determining the injured structure because many of the ligaments are quite superﬁcial and can therefore be located with ease. It is often useful to ask the athlete to “point with one ﬁnger” where it is most painful. The most frequent area for pain is around the antero-lateral ankle. The medial aspect of the ankle may be painful if there was an eversion force that injured the medial ligament complex although it is also not uncommon for it to be painful following an inversion injury if there was some medial joint compression causing some bone bruising. The pain from syndesmosis and talar dome injuries tends to be more centrally located, deeper and more diffuse. Ankle fractures tend to be exquisitely painful on palpation. The most common sites of ankle fractures are the distal ﬁbula and the 5th metatarsal. These sites should be carefully examined (see the Ottawa Ankle Rules, below)."}

Radiographic investigations and the Ottawa Ankle Rules In the majority of cases, imaging of the acutely in- jured ankle is not necessary, as it does not alter the management of the athlete. There are some key ex- ceptions, however, and these mainly revolve around the need to exclude an ankle fracture. In 1992, the Ottawa Ankle Rules (OAR) were published, which provide clinicians with guidance regarding referring an injured ankle for radiographic investigation (Stiell et al.1992). According to these rules, it is only nec- essary to seek an X-ray of an injured ankle in those patients with: r pain along the posterior edge of the distal 6cm of the ﬁbula (including the tip of the malleolus); or r an inability to walk more than four steps either immediately or at a subsequent closer assessment within 10 days; or r pain at the base of the 5th metatarsal. Should the patient present with any of these signs, they should be referred for an X-ray with anteropos- terior (AP), lateral and mortise views. In the mortise view, the talus should be equidistant between the malleoli before a syndesmosis disruption can be ex- cluded (Lynch 2002). Implementation of the OAR have resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of x-rays taken with no reduction in the detection of ankle fractures (Leddy et al.1998)."}
{"id": "2217", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Other investigations such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerised tomography (CT) and ultrasongraphy (US) are typically unnecessary in the acutely injured ankle because usually they do not change clinical management, which is primarily based on symptoms, although they may be helpful in excluding an osteochondral lesion/talar dome frac- ture. Down the line, should the athlete’s progress not be as swift as expected, these imaging techniques may be employed. CT is best for imaging osteochon- dral injuries, whereas US is the preferred technique for the imaging of tendon pathology (Shalabi et al.2007). US imaging is growing in popularity due to the fact that it can provide dynamic imaging of the foot and ankle, and in particular the soft tissues. For example, it is possible to view the ﬂexor hallucis longus tendon slide round the medial malleolus and through the ﬁbro-osseous tunnel as the ankle moves through its range of motion in the sagittal plane. This has the advantage of the athlete being able to inter- act with the ultrasonogropher or radiologist and they can demonstrate the movement and indeed the stage of the movement that provokes their pain. This is particularly useful when the athlete has a functional, rather than just an anatomical or structural pathol- ogy. At this stage, MRI and CT scans are still limited to static imaging. Physical examination Like every joint, the ankle should be examined in sequence."}

Stress tests Manual stress tests are often used in the clinical setting to determine the type and extent of ankle ligament injury. The two most common stress tests used for the ankle are the talar tilt test and the anterior draw test. Anterior Draw Test This test assesses the anterior translation of the talus with respect to the tibia. It is best performed with the patient sitting up with their legs over the edge of the bed in order to relax the gastrocnemius. The tibia is stabilised with one hand and the other hand grasps the talus and draws it forward in the sagittal plane. A positive test is said to be one where there is greater anterior displacement of the foot with respect to the lower leg when compared to the uninjured side. It has been stated that sagittal plane displacement of greater than 3mm is indicative of an ATFL lesion (Anderson et al.1952) although like many manual stress tests, the results remain largely subjective and should therefore be used as a guide only. It can also frequently provide false negative results if there is guarding of the ankle due to pain or a thickened fat pad at the posterior calcaneal tuberosity (Johnson and Markolf 1983)."}

The TT test is performed with the an- kle in slight plantarﬂexion, the tibia and ﬁbula held stable. The calcaneus and talus is grasped with the other hand and “tilted” into inversion.

The current consensus of opinion is steered to- wards functional, non-operative treatment, irrespec- tive of the amount of ligamentous laxity demon- strated on stress testing. As a consequence, the treat- ment of the injured ankle is contingent on the func- tional status of the ankle and so the exact degree of ligamentous laxity may indeed be moot.

If the player has an immediate effusion or bruising and/or is unable to weight bear, they should be removed from the ﬁeld. If the decision is made to allow the player to continue playing, they should be observed to ensure that he is able to run freely, change directions and decelerate rapidly. If they cannot perform these tasks, there is a likelihood of a more serious injury and should be taken from the ﬁeld for a more thorough assessment and immediate management."}

Clinical judgement grading based on functional ability. In this method, a grade I injury is assessed as involving no or minimal functional loss, no extra joint ROM, little or no pain, swelling or bruising. A grade II injury is where the patient’s ankle ROM is reduced al- though accessory movement testing reveals extra joint movement but a ﬁrm end-feel, moderate pain over the injured ligament, swelling and bruising. A grade III injury implies complete rupture where there is no longer an end-feel on accessory movement testing, overall joint motion is markedly reduced, there is marked swelling and bruising and function has been lost. Syndesmosis strains The ankle syndesmosis is composed of the anterior inferior tibioﬁbular ligament (AITFL), the posterior inferior tibioﬁbular ligament (PITFL) and the in- terosseous membrane. The mechanism of injury is forced external rotation of the weight bearing foot or forced plantarﬂexion such as rolling over the front of the ankle. Injuries to the syndesmosis have his- torically been underdiagnosed and are a signiﬁcant source of chronic ankle pain in the athlete. Like other ankle ligament sprains, injuries to the syndesmo- sis are often graded in terms of amount of damage sustained with a Grade I indicating AITFL stretch, Grade II indicating AITFL partial tear and Grade III indicating complete AITFL rupture (O’Donoghue 1984)."}

For this test, the athlete is seated with their legs overhanging the couch, hips and knees ﬂexed to 90 degrees. The lower limb is stabilised with one hand whilst the other hand dorsiﬂexes and externally rotates the foot. A grade I-II injury should be immo- bilised in a walking boot until pain free (typically up to 2 weeks) and needs to be followed by a progres- sive active rehabilitation programme. A weightbear- ing X-ray that demonstrates widening of the mortise may require a surgical opinion with a view to inter- nal ﬁxation. Following surgical ﬁxation of a grade III syndesmosis strain, an athlete may be back to athletic competition in around six weeks following a progres- sive rehabilitation programme (Taylor et al.2007). Other causes of anterior ankle pain Anterior impingement Anterior impingement occurs when either anterio- raly located hypertrophied soft tissue, boney exosto- sis on the talus or tibia, or loose body limits tibio-talar dorsiﬂexion. The athlete complains of persistent pain at the front of the ankle, particularly when lunging. It is also commonly seen in football in the non- dominant kicking leg."}

It is often seen after a lateral ankle sprain where there may be arthrokinematic changes that limit the posterior glide of the talus in the mortise (Hubbard and Hertel 2006). There may be tenderness on palpation of the anterior joint line and in advanced cases, it may be possible to feel a boney spur. Manual therapy to restore normal accessory talus motion and anti-inﬂammatory medications/modalities are often helpful and a period of rest from loaded dorsiﬂexion activities is recommended. Tape can be applied to limit the extent of talo-crual dorsiﬂexion. Sinus tarsi syndrome The sinus tarsi is a small tunnel that is located near the talar neck and the calcaneus at the antero-lateral aspect of the ankle, slightly antero-inferior to the lateral malleolus. The sinus tarsi is densely packed with synovial tissue that is easily inﬂamed. In the majority of cases, the athlete will have a history of at least one ankle sprain and present complaining of diffuse pain slightly below and anterior to the ATFL (Oloff et al.2001).

Talar dome injuries can be tested clinically by pal- pating the talar dome (best located just distal to the tibial plafond when the ankle is plantar ﬂexed). They are best diagnosed with an MRI scan (Mosher 2006) but CT scanning may be required as an adjunct to determine the extent of the chondral surface dam- age and, dependent on the extent of the lesion, may need surgical stabilisation, after which a compre- hensive and extensive rehabilitation programme is necessary. Lateral ankle pain Peroneal tendinopathy Peroneal tendinopathy is usually an overuse injury and is one of the most common causes of non- traumatic lateral ankle pain. The athlete will usually present with an insidious onset of lateral ankle pain, often located either posterior to the lateral malleolus, at the base of the 5th metatarsal. A retrospective review of 40 patients who un- derwent peroneal tendon repair for peroneal ten- don tears demonstrated that the peroneus brevis was by far the most commonly implicated tendon (88% of cases) with the rest being made up of peroneus longus tears. In 37% of cases there was a combined brevis and longus tear. The average age of the patient was 42 years and the most commonly reported mech- anism of injury was a lateral ankle sprain (Dombek et al.2003).

Soft tissue therapy is useful to re- duce muscle tone in the peroneals and gastro-soleus complex but there is some evidence to suggest that aggressive stretching of a pathological tendon is not advisable. Whilst strengthening of the peroneals is vital in both the acute and degenerative condition, the more chronic the situation, the more likely it is to respond to eccentric loading (Alfredson and Cook 2007). Iselin’s disease Iselin’s disease is a traction apophysitis of the per- oneus brevis at its attachment onto the base of the 5th metatarsal. It is found in adolescents, particu- larly those with a prominent 5th metatarsal that par- ticipates in sports that require sudden changes in direction such as football, lacrosse and cross coun- try running. Treatment for Iselin’s disease is always conservative and may involve rest from provocative activities, anti-inﬂammatory interventions and med- ications followed by a progressive rehabilitation pro- gramme. Posterior ankle pain Posterior ankle impingement (PAI) syndrome The posterior aspect of the ankle is a common site of pain in the athlete who participates in activities that requires extremes of talo-crual plantarﬂexion such as taekwondo, ballet, running and football. PAI is labelled as a “syndrome” because it is an umbrella term that is used to describe pain anywhere in the posterior region of the ankle joint.

Traumatic hyperplantarﬂexion can result in a frac- ture of the posterior talar process or traumatic pos- terior joint synovitis. Post-traumatic calciﬁcation of the joint capsule can occur as a late consequence of a plantarﬂexion plus inversion ankle sprain. The athlete will usually describe a pain at the back of the ankle that they confuse with the Achilles tendon. Palpation of the Achilles tendon, however, is usually unremarkable although palpation of the posterior aspect of the talus will usually reproduce their pain. The pain is usually aggravated by forced plantar ﬂexion. In the painful position, a medial glide on the calcaneus will usually compress the me- dial structures and a lateral glide will compress the lateral structures, helping to differentially diagnose between posteromedial and posterolateral impinge- ment. Rehabilitation should address any contributory talo-crual, mid foot and sub-talar joint hypomobil- ity, hypertonic or tight FHL, triceps surae and per- oneals and improving calf muscle and intrinsic mus- cle endurance. This is in addition to correcting any biomechanical/ alignment issues."}

Occasionally, surgical excision of any structural ab- normalities/loose bodies may be required (Lee et al.2008b). Medial ankle pain Deltoid ligament sprain The most commonly reported mechanism of injury to the deltoid ligament is when the athlete has their foot planted on the ground in a pronated position and then falls outward, placing a large abduction force on the ligament (Lynch 2002). Given the amount of force required to injure the deltoid ligament, there is a high probability of injury to associated structures. For this reason, it is reasonable to expect rehabilita- tion to be a much lengthier process than for a lateral ankle sprain, although the principles of injury man- agement are very similar. Flexor hallucis longus pathology FHL tenosynovitis is an important cause of postero- medial ankle pain. It is particularly common in ballet dancers and kicking athletes due to the extraordinary range of motion that the tendon must travel from a fully dorsiﬂexed position to a fully plantar ﬂexed one. The athlete will often complain of posterior an- kle pain on landing from a jump or when striking a kick/ball impact. It can be differentially diagnosed by medially gliding the calcaneus whilst in end range talo-crual plantarﬂexion."}

This is often referred to as stenosing tenosynovitis (Hamilton et al.1996). A steroid injection may be useful in the short term to reduce any inﬂammatory component but the athlete will also need assessment and reha- bilitation of any biomechanical abnormalities when they are in a plantar ﬂexed position. Frequently, if the calcaneus is abducted (known as ‘sickling out’) when a heel raise is performed, compression of the FHL will occur and re-education of this movement is required. Should conservative measures fail, surgical intervention may be required. Tibialis posterior pathology Tibialis posterior tendon injury is classically an en- tity of overuse and is characterised by medial ankle pain may track down to its insertion on the navic- ular tubercle (although it does also have distal at- tachments onto the cuboid, all three cuneiforms, the plantar calcaneonavicular (spring) ligament and the 2nd and 4th metatarsals). The function of the tibialis posterior is to invert the subtalar and midfoot joints and to help stabilise the medial longitudinal arch. It can become subjected to an overuse injury in the athlete with excessive subtalar joint pronation but is also susceptible to direct trauma.

Tarsal tunnel syndrome is a painful condition involving entrapment of the posterior tib- ial nerve in the tarsal tunnel and is characterised by a burning pain in the toes, plantar aspect of the foot or around the tarsal tunnel itself which is worsened by load-bearing (Kinoshita et al.2006). Occasion- ally there may be a positive Tinel’s sign but may also require nerve conduction studies and/or MRI. Conservative treatment involves rest, orthotic or tape intervention to reduce excessive STJ pronation and sometimes, steroid injection.

Stress fractures in the ankle complex Stress fractures involving the ankle complex are not common but it is important that they are not missed in an assessment. Table 22.4 outlines the more common sites of stress fractures. Treatment of a stress fracture in the ankle will most often require non-weight bearing or sometimes surgical internal ﬁxation.

A recent study by Aiken and colleagues (2008) demonstrated that although there was a natu- ral recovery of strength and dorsiﬂexion ROM within 1 month following a grade I or II ankle sprain, more sensitive measures of ankle performance demon- strated ongoing deﬁcits in those patients that did not receive rehabilitation intervention. The authors suggested that the ongoing disability following an ankle sprain in people who received only standard emergency care provided evidence of the need for more comprehensive rehabilitation plan. This result has been augmented by a study which demonstrated the superiority of a structured 4-week rehabilitation programme compared to a non-intervention control group on postural control and lower limb function on individuals with chronic ankle instability (Hale et al.2007). A comprehensive rehabilitation aims to control pain and swelling, restore full joint ROM and kinematics, proprioceptive function, muscle strength and functional performance. Acute management The principles of acute ankle injury management are similar to those of other joints, namely to protect the joint, and to reduce pain and effusion. Protecting the joint primarily involves preventing further damage. This may involve removal from the ﬁeld of play, or reducing weight bearing with crutches.

The use of cryotherapy is widely practised in the acute management of acute soft tissue injuries. The purported beneﬁts of this are the early control of oedema and haemorrhage from damaged vessels, as well as pain relief. Whilst a theoretical argument can be made to support these claims, as yet there is very little substantive proof that the use of cryotherapy improves clinical outcomes following ankle or other soft tissue injury (Collins 2008). The most common method of cryotherapy is applying crushed ice di- rectly to the injured area although plunging the in- jured ankle into a bucket of iced water is potentially more effective as it combines both the reduced tem- perature and the compression provided by the water required to restrict vessel diameter and thereby re- duce plasma leakage from the vessels. The cooling effect of the ice also helps to reduce pain and may potentially lower cell metabolism, thereby reducing the hypoxia that can lead to cell death. In the ﬁrst 48 hours, immersing the ankle into an ice bath should be for a maximum of 20 minutes (intermittently) but should be encouraged every 2 hours. In between times, a horseshoe fabricated from felt or foam can be placed around the malleolus and secured with a compressive bandage. Anti-inﬂammatory medica- tions are discouraged initially because the inﬂam- matory process is necessary for the healing process to commence but may be commenced after 48 hours to ensure that the inﬂammatory process is not exces- sive, in particular, to control the collateral damage that may be caused by excessive neutrophil-mediated activity."}

Restoration of joint ROM and kinematics Full weight bearing should be encouraged as soon as possible so long as the gait pattern is not an- talgic. This may necessitate an initial period of par- tial weight bearing with crutches or walking in a pool (to reduce loading). Manual therapy to restore normal talo-crual kinematics and motion at the sub- talar and midtarsal joints can be beneﬁcial. It has been suggested that there may be a positional fault at the inferior tibio-ﬁbualr joint following an acute ankle sprain (Kavanagh 1999) and this may need to be assessed and corrected with mobilisations. Ac- tive mobilisations should be commenced as soon as is comfortable and this may involve the use of a sta- tionary bike or cross-trainer, hourly range of motion exercises and lunging (particularly in a bucket of iced water). Proprioceptive retraining Ankle injuries can disrupt the body’s neuromuscular feedforward and feedback mechanisms, which may be displayed as reduced proprioception. Propriocep- tion is the internally generated afferent information arising from peripheral areas of the body that con- tributes to postural control and joint stability. It is made up of joint position sense, kinaesthesia and resistance/force sense (Riemann and Lephart 2002)."}
{"id": "2240", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "There is strong evidence that people with chronically unstable ankles demonstrate proprioceptive deﬁcits whether it be in errors in detecting ankle positions prior to ground contact (Konradsen 2002), failure to accurately replicate passively positioned joint angles (Willems et al.2002), or an inability to accurately set appropriate muscle force levels to provide joint stability prior to landing from a jump (Docherty and Miller 2002; Docherty and Arnold 2008). It seems that these proprioceptive deﬁcits impair the athlete’s ability to prepare the ankle to accept and transfer load in challenging athletic tasks such as changing directions and landing from a jump. There is no overwhelming argument for a deﬁni- tive cause of such proprioceptive deﬁcits although alterations in gamma-motoneuron activity affecting muscle spindle sensitivity and reducing the “dy- namic defence system” of the ankle are thought to predispose the athlete to repeated bouts of instabil- ity (Hertel 2002). Indeed, a recent study showed that proprioceptive training was more effective than or- thotics or strength training in reducing the rates of ankle sprains in male soccer players (Mohammadi 2007). Given these proprioceptive deﬁcits are noted in the chronically unstable ankle, it is important to com- mence proprioceptive training very early on in the rehabilitation programme. Initially this may involve single leg standing and can be made more challeng- ing by performing this with eyes closed and on less stable surfaces such as a trampoline. Wobble boards"}

The SEBT is a dynamic lower limb reaching test that has been shown to be sensi- tive in detecting subjects with chronic ankle insta- bility (Olmsted et al.2002). It involves standing on the ground with the affected foot and reaching as far as possible to touch but not weight-bear on eight di- agonal lines positioned 45 degrees from each other in a star shape. Essentially, any activity that chal- lenges the body’s proprioceptive system is useful and the more input the system receives the better. There are several variables that can be adapted to make the tasks more challenging (see Table 22.5 for examples). The proprioceptive programme should be progres- sive, fun, challenging, functional and goal-orientated towards the sport-speciﬁc demands. Additionally, as healing progresses, the stress that the ankle is put under during these proprioceptive drills needs to be increased to include jumping, hopping, turning and cutting tasks. There are no speciﬁc rules about pro- gressing the drills but each of the variables (above) should be taken into consideration.

This will involve working into progressively more plantarﬂexion and inversion. Interestingly, the current prevailing thought is that whilst strength is an important consideration during ankle rehabilitation, deﬁcits in ankle strength are not highly correlated with chronic ankle instability (Kaminski 2006) al- though recently it has been found that there may be a deﬁcit ineccentricplantar ﬂexionstrengthinsubjects with functional ankle instability (Fox et al.2008).

The clinical signiﬁcance of these ﬁndings is that muscle strength should be assessed but not be used as the only return to sport benchmark. It is also important to note that if the athlete is having to take an extended period of time out from their sport due to this injury, it is vital that their cardiovascular sys- tem and total body strength work is not neglected (these should be maintained, if not improved during the rehabilitative process)."}

This will involve a careful analysis of the require- ments of the sport and the impacts it will have on the ankle. For example, for a basketballer, their re- habilitation programme will need to progress from jumping on the spot, to jumping for distance and height, landing in a contest for the ball as well as sudden deceleration and changing of direction when running. For a squash player, there may be more of an emphasis on lunging and rapid pivoting on the foot. Frequently, the athlete will require the appli- cation of tape to support the ankle when returning to more vigorous activities. Dependent on the struc- tures that require supporting/protecting, this will of- ten involve positioning the ankle in dorsiﬂexion (or at least neutral) and eversion, and the application of a combination of anchors, stirrups, calcaneal slings, heel locks, ﬁgure 6s and sometimes syndesmosis strips. Taping has been shown to restrict the amount of ankle inversion (Arnold and Docherty 2004) but the beneﬁt is likely to be largely proprioceptive or even placebo (Sawkins et al.2007). Whilst there are no high-quality studies on how long taping should be used for, clinical experience dictates that it should be used for as long as the athlete ﬁnds it beneﬁcial. Nonetheless, the athlete should be counselled that it is probably better not to develop a reliance on taping in case for some reason or other taping is not possible down the track."}

Risk factors for ankle sprains Several factors have been proposed as risks to ankle sprains over the years. One recent published study suggested that slower running speed, poor cardiores- piratory endurance, impaired joint position sense and increased postural sway, decreased tibialis anterior strength, decreased dorsiﬂexion ROM and increased activity of the gastro-soleus complex were associated with an increased risk of ankle inversion sprains in males (Willems et al.2005)."}

Chronic ankle instability The rate of recurrence of an ankle sprain has been reported to be as high as 80% (Yeung et al.1994) and yet the reasons why this rate is so high are still somewhat mysterious. Chronic ankle instabil- ity (CAI) is the term used to describe the occurrence of repeated bouts of instability leading to numerous ankle sprains (Hertel 2002). It has been estimated that CAI occurs in 30–40% of individuals who suffer ﬁrst time ankle sprains but the occurrence of resid- ual symptoms and decreased function are reported to be much higher (Hertel 2006). CAI gives rise to re- peated complaints of pain, swelling, giving way, and degenerative joint disease. Interestingly, it appears that CAI is independent of the severity of the orig- inal injury and of the treatment received (Kaminski and Hartsell 2002). It is unclear why some individu- als go on to suffer CAI. The mechanism of recurrent ankle sprains is not thought to be dramatically dif- ferent to that of an initial sprain."}
{"id": "2248", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Clearly, there is no such thing as a simple ankle sprain. Ankle instability can be due to mechanical causes or functional causes. Mechanical Ankle Instability (MAI) refers to repeated episodes of ‘giving way’ due to structural abnormalities within the ankle com- plex. This can be due to: r pathological ligamentous laxity r athrokinematic abnormalities (such as restricted posterior talar glide in the mortise that limits the ankle’s ability to reach a fully dorsiﬂexed (i.e. close-packed) position) r synovial inﬂammation and degenerative joint changes (such as degenerative osteochondral le- sions). Functional Ankle Instability (FAI) is said to occur when there are repeated episodes of ‘giving-way’ without a speciﬁc mechanical cause (Kaminski and Hartsell 2002). FAI is a complex matrix of contribut- ing factors that may include: r impaired proprioception (joint position sense, ki- naesthesia and joint resistance sense) (Hertel 2002) r muscle weakness and arthrogenic muscle inhibi- tion r altered postural equilibrium sense (Riemann 2002) r reduction in preparatory muscle activity to sta- bilise the ankle prior to ground contact (Hertel 2006) It appears that CAI may be the product of an inter- action between MAI and FAI although despite bur- geoning research into this area, the precise nature and interaction of all the contributing factors is still un- clear (Kaminski and Hartsell 2002). An interesting area of current research is concentrating on the possi- bilities that delayed trunk reﬂexes may predispose an individual to CAI. It seems that central nervous sys- tem adaptations in the manner of delayed stabilisa- tion times are found in individuals with FAI, which is a ﬁnding somewhat akin to those found in individuals with low back pain (Marshall et al.2009). A deeper appreciation of the features of CAI will help provide the sports clinician with a framework to structure a comprehensive rehabilitation plan aiming at not just the management of the acute ankle sprain but also the avoidance of the potential chronic sequelae."}

Analysis It was concluded that Allan had sustained an acute ATFL injury. Whilst the clinician was unable to as- sess the degree of laxity in the ATFL, it was decided that he was functioning as a Grade III injury. Given Allan’s past history of ankle sprains, it was con- cluded that this was an acute episode of CAI. Management (days 1–3) Initially, the priority for management was to protect the injured area and limit an excessive inﬂammatory reaction. Consequently the interventions were: r Educating Allan regarding the diagnosis, the pain mechanisms involved, the plan for treatment and the likely prognosis. It was also important that he be educated regarding CAI and the need to rehabilitate fully in order to reduce the risk of further injuries.r RICE regimen."}

Following this an elasticised compressive bandage with a padded felt “horse shoe” was applied around the lateral malleolus to ensure uniform compression around the injured area.r Basic balance exercises were prescribed.r He was provided with a set of elbow crutches and instructed to only put as much weight through his injured side as was pain free. The motto of “it is preferable to walk well with an aid than poorly without”. He was instructed in the safe usage of crutches on the ﬂat and on stairs. Assessment (day 3) Allan had improved greatly over the course of the two days following the injury. He was now able to walk well without the aid of crutches. The ankle was swollenalthoughmuchless than48hours previously. He still had pain when the ankle was plantarﬂexed had not attempted to jog."}

Management (days 4–7) The aims for management now moved to being about functional restoration. Allan had access to a local gymnasium that contained a pool and so he was al- lowed to walk in the pool as a means of gait re- education. It was also the ideal environment to com- mence lunging and provided a challenging environ- ment for balance re-training. Resistive hip strengthening as well as pelvic con- trol and functional balance work was commenced during this period. Manual therapy was concentrat- ing on normalising muscle tone around the ankle"}

He was given a home exercise pro- gramme that was to be completed twice daily. Assessment (day 8) At the beginning of week 2, Allan’s pain was ab- sent during all ADLs and he was able to jog in a straight line. Additionally, whilst there was still some swelling evident around the lateral aspect of his ankle, the postero-lateral gutter had cleared and bruising was no longer evident. His knee-to-wall measurement was 6cm. He was considered to have a functional grade I+ strain by this stage. Management (days 8–14) Week two’s programme showed a progressive in- crease in lower limb load, both statically and dy- namically. There was a gradual increase in gait speed from walking to jogging, initially in straight lines and then in gentle curves. Some agility work was intro- duced using ladders and other proprioceptive drills. He was asked to monitor his symptoms (pain and swelling) after each session and if there was an in- crease in symptoms, he was not allowed to progress to the next day’s programme."}

He was permitted to return to non-competitive, sub-threshold football training. He was a winger and so a running speed programme was given to him by the coach and he was permit- ted to re-commence striking a non-moving ball over progressively longer distances. Manual therapy continued throughout this week and by day 14, talo-crual joint mechanics had been restored. By day 14, he was considered to have a grade I strain. This was because he was still getting a small amount of swelling following the second loading session of the day. Assessment (day15) Allan had regained full physiological and accessory movement of his ankle complex by this stage. There was approximately 2–3mm of extra anterior draw. It was unable to be ascertained whether this was due to the most recent injury or was pre-existing. Management (days 15–21) The aims of the 3rd week of the programme were to integrate speciﬁc functional tasks into his rehabil- itation."}

He completed a full training session on day 17 without any latent pain or refractory swelling. He played a competitive cup match at day 22. Ongoing management Given that Allan had a long history of ankle sprains, resisted ankle strengthening work as well as propri- oceptive drills focusing on landing mechanics (for example, hopping onto a wobble board/landing from a step into a sandpit) were continued three times per week for the next two months.

ACUTE MANAGEMENT This refers to the ﬁrst 48 hours after your ankle in- jury and is vital in your overall recovery. Following an injury and subsequent tissue damage, your body responds through a process of inﬂammation. Inﬂam- mation is good for us and is a necessary part of the healing process. The problem is, the response can be a bit exaggerated and so we look to reduce the amount of swelling. That is why you are re- quired to ice and compress the ankle in the early stages. Assessment A physiotherapy and perhaps a medical review is necessary to assess the extent of your injury and proceed with any further investigations (such as an x-ray or MRI) if deemed necessary. The physiotherapist will also inform you when you can start this rehabilitation program. It is ex- pected that you will complete every level as de- scribed, if you have any questions about or problems with the exercises you must discuss these with your physiotherapist at the time. Ice Ice applied to the injury site helps limit bleeding and controls inﬂammation in the ankle and can also helps in pain relief."}
{"id": "2262", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The best manner of cooling the injury is the use of an ice bath because the water provides compression as well. It also reduces the risk of an ice burn that may occur by applying ice directly onto the skin. Because excessive cooling may be counterpro- ductive, icing needs to be limited to 20-minute periods. How to use an ice bath: Half ﬁll a suitable container with cold water and add ice. Place your foot into the container; making sure the site of injury is well covered. Every 5 minutes, take your foot out of the water and perform 10 ankle lunges so long as they are not too painful. Repeat this 4 times. After this process, dry your foot and apply the compression bandage. Repeat this process every hour if possible. Compression Compression can be very effective in controlling the swelling that often accompanies an ankle sprain."}

Make sure you don’t apply the bandage too tight or it may restrict blood ﬂow. If necessary, you will be provided with an aircast boot to reduce the risk of re-injury in the acute phase.

Taking the forces of the whole body, plus additional impact sometimes reaching several times body mass, the foot is under tremendous stress. In sport the foot absorbs loading and shearing forces, and to manage the disorders as- sociated there must be a good understanding of the anatomy and biomechanics of the foot. To under- stand treat and rehabilitate foot problems, a working knowledge of the individual sports and the injuries that are commonly associated with techniques and training methods is essential. A study by Vereecke and Aerts 2008 on gibbons, the most bipedal of non-human primates and the most distant relatives of humans within the ape lin- eage, indicated the human foot evolved from one that was primarily of an arboreal (tree dweller) na- ture, to one that was a kind of hybrid, and ﬁnally to the very ﬂexible, yet simultaneously force ab- sorbent locomotive mechanism adapted to bipedal- ism. Vereecke et al. (2005) maintained an arboreal compliant foot may not be the most effective mecha- nism for push-off during bipedal locomotion, partic- ularly when compared to the more rigid arched foot of humans, but it does contribute to propulsion in as much as it uses stored elastic energy from passive stretch and recoil of the tendons and ligaments on the plantar side of the foot. We do still possess extremes of foot posture which tend to predispose to increased potential for injury in sport (Burns et al.2005), coupled with the tendency for some foot types being more suited to certain sports and susceptible to types of injury (Barnes et al.2008)."}

Burns et al. (2005) demonstrate that athletes with a conﬂicting foot type to their discipline appear to be more prone to injury, as with any biomechanical preferences of certain sports. As with many other parts of the human anatomy, that are functioning and adapting constantly, the foot is only noticed when it fails to function in its subliminal, reliable way. High arched semi-rigid feet (Figure 23.1) In extreme form these feet have been described as Pes Cavus or even Claw Foot. This primarily genetic defect in the foot has a high arch which is relatively inﬂexible. This will often be associated with tight calf muscles combined with reduced dorsiﬂexion, and predispose to toe running even at slow speeds with little or no heel contact.

Athletes ﬁnd they need to stretch the calf mus- cles before and particularly after activity for around 30 seconds, repeated three times, once a day (Bandy et al.1997) and maintain dorsiﬂexion, although stretching before and after exercise has not been shown to necessarily reduce risk of injury (Herbert and Gabriel 2002). Shoe type selection is difﬁcult as there needs to be support to counter the impact and ﬂexibility to allow some compensatory movement (Orendurff et al.2008). Flat flexible feet (Figure 23.2) Again primarily inherent, this foot type requires shoe selection to provide motion control to avoid stress on structures in some activities, but allow enough movement to tolerate longer contact impact in others (Chuckpalwong et al.2008). Injuries caused by either overuse or as a result of a structural non-conformity to the sport are sim- ilar in that only through signiﬁcant activity do pre- existing or underlying structural problems usually reveal themselves. The development of an extremely wide choice of shoes, insoles and orthoses means there is the potential to inﬂuence the right com- pensatory combination to reduce injury potential, but also increases the need for more experience and knowledge of sport speciﬁcs, shoe construction and supplemental biomechanical device prescription."}

Injuries to the rearfoot Plantar fasciitis Buchbinder (2004) maintains plantar fasciitis is not only the most common cause of pain in the infe- rior heel, but is responsible for approximately 10% of all running related injuries. Plantar fasciitis is in- ﬂammation of the plantar fascia, which may radiate into the arch of the foot aggravated by weight bear- ing and propulsive activity. It is an overuse injury usually causing plantar proximal and medial pain which may radiate distally to the mid-arch. A strain or sometimes rupture with either gradual or sudden overload is quite common, especially in the active sport population. Plantar fasciitis can be related to a ‘heel spur’, which is a bony exostosis at the attachment of the plantar fascia to the calcaneus."}

In sport it is often associated with harder training surfaces or increased intensity or duration of training (Huerta et al.2008). The lateral plantar nerve passes through the tarsal tunnel between the abductor hallucis muscle and the quadratus planus muscle. It may become compressed causing similar pain under the heel, and sometimes up towards the medial ankle. Treatment and rehabilitation Rest including unloading the foot with supportive taping, and even crutches in the early stages, is es- sential (Cole et al.2005). A night splint to hold the foot stretched into dorsiﬂexion can reduce the overnight tendency to tighten (Figure 23.3).

Extracorporeal shock therapy, in- ducing signiﬁcant vibratory impact directly to the area, has conﬂicting research evidence (Buchbinder 2002; Sems et al.2006). Heel contusion Repetitive impact on the heel can cause the fat pad that protects the calcaneus to be pushed up the side of the heel leaving less of a protective layer.

Treatment and rehabilitation Insoles are more effective than heel pads as they dissipate rather than concentrate pressure; plus pads raising the heel without supporting the arch, destabilise the foot, increasing stress on the arch (Gosky et al.2006).

Calcaneal stress fracture A stress fracture can occur in the calcaneum as a result of cumulative impact. It is common in sports like long distance running (Fredricson et al.2006), particularly with athletes who predominantly heel strike rather than mid to forefoot strike, which tends to be the heavier jogger or slower running athlete. The majority of plantar heel pain is probably diag- nosed as plantar fasciitis or as heel spurs. When the history or examination ﬁndings are atypical or when routine treatment is ineffective, consideration should be given to atypical causes of heel pain (Webber et al.2005). Stress fractures of the calcaneus are possibly a frequently unrecognised source of heel pain. In some cases they can continue to go unrecognised because the symptoms of calcaneal stress fracture sometimes improve with treatments aimed at soft tissue injuries."}
{"id": "2301", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Calcaneal stress fractures can occur in any popula- tion of adults and are common among active people, such as running athletes. It is very likely that the in- cidence of diagnosed calcaneal stress fractures will rise with an increased consideration of their possi- bility. Commonly (Webber et al.2005) there is an insidious, gradual onset pain, made worse by weight bearing. Pain is reproduced by squeezing the back of the heel from both sides. X-ray will frequently not show any sign of fracture at all, or until after approximately two weeks. Treatment and rehabilitation A stress fracture should be suspected if there is in- active or night pain, and requires rest from impact for 6–8 weeks, often including crutches in the early stages (McRae and Esser 2008). Return to sporting impact must be gradual. Ideally starting with mini- mal heel weight bearing activities, like hydrotherapy, cycling and rowing; progressing to elliptical trainer and treadmill intervals before running. Conversely it may be more appropriate to run quicker intervals on toes rather than slower runs with more heel impact initially."}

Nerve entrapment This can be described as ‘tarsal tunnel syndrome’ or ‘medial calcaneal nerve entrapment’. The two con- ditions are similar with variable symptoms of pain that can be in the heel, toes or the arch of the foot, and numbness and/or pins and needles may be felt in the sole of the foot. There is usually pain when stand- ing and more when running. ‘Tinel’s test’, tapping the nerve just behind the medial malleolus, is uncom- fortably sensitive. Ankle eversion and foot pronation appear to stress and irritate the medial and lateral plantar nerves, causing the ‘tarsal tunnel syndrome’ variation (Kinoshita et al.2006). Treatment and rehabilitation Slow controlled non weight-bearing exercise pro- gressing to weight bearing in positions that do not aggravate; passive mobilisation and manipula- tion, cryotherapy (ice treatment) or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) which may re- duce sensitivity. Insoles or orthotics to alter the mechanical loading pattern are sometimes beneﬁ- cial (DiDomenico and Masternick 2006). However, when conservative measures are not successful, sur- gical decompression (Mullick and Dellon 2008) or excision may result in relief of pain, fortunately with few potential complications Sever’s disease This condition which is sometimes called calcaneal apophysitis occurs primarily in active children around the age of 9–14 years (Malanga and Ramirez-Del Toro 2008)."}

Use of a brace or cast does help, probably by inhibiting activity as well as weight bearing. A biomechanical assessment may indicate potential reasons for increased stress on the heel, which if reduced by insoles or orthoses, may assist recovery (Hendrix 2005). The most consistent difference between normal and Sever’s patients is related to the more fragmented nature of the symp- tomatic epiphysis, which may suggest a mechanical etiology for that condition (Volpon and de Carvalho Filho 2002). Modiﬁed types of training with less im- pact are therefore usually necessary for prevention or resolution. Retrocalcaneal bursitis and Haglund’s deformity (Figure 23.5) Pain at the back of the heel caused by an inﬂamed bursa which is situated between the Achilles tendon and the calcaneum (Haglund 1972). This is a com- mon condition in athletes, particularly in running related sports, and is often associated with Achilles tendinopathy. A MRI study on Achilles tendonopa- thy enthesitis found retrocalcaneal bursitis in three- quarters of cases (D’Agostini and Olivieri 2006). The key to successful management is a proper under- standing of the anatomy and pathological processes (Solan and Davies 2007). Sensitivity and swelling are especially aggravated when running uphill or on uneven surfaces."}

Figure 23.5 Haglund’s deformity of the calcaneum. A bony growth or exostosis can develop at the posterior calcaneum called ‘Haglund’s deformity’. If conservative management fails then surgery may be necessary to repair the Achilles tendon and reduce the exostosis (Stephens 1994). Treatment and rehabilitation Insoles or orthotics to alter the calcaneal alignment can reduce irritation from the side of the Achilles that may be causing avulsion stress, as well as diminish pressure and movement that may be causing fric- tional irritation (Heneghan and Pavlov 1984). Anti- inﬂammatory medication orally and even topically, as part of the inﬂammation is superﬁcial, with pro- tective dressing, usually assists recovery, however, injection or even surgery are used in persistent cases. Achilles tendinopathy (Figure 23.6) The Achilles tendon may be damaged and inﬂamed primarily through overloading during the propulsive phase of the gait cycle. It can be injured cumulatively with overtraining without sufﬁcient recovery, or sud- denly, for example by increased quality of training on a harder surface (Paavola et al.2002).

A primary reason for the pain becoming chronic is that discomfort experienced often reduces signiﬁ- cantly with the start of activity. This is probably due to reactive loss of sensitivity, giving the athlete a false impression with pain returning after the activ- ity. A thickening in the tendon, particularly 2–3 cm proximal to the calcaneum may then develop. An ex- tension of the blood supply may develop (Knobloch et al.2006), which is now considered to be detri- mental to recovery. Ohberg and Alfredson (2002) analysed blood ﬂow in painful Achilles tendons and found some evidence that new blood vessels in the tendon were the cause of tendon pain. MRI or ul- trasound scans only have moderate correlation with clinical assessment (Khan et al.2003), indicating accurate assessment is more signiﬁcant in determin- ing the degree of Achilles pathology and therefore outcome expectation.

This should only be temporary during recovery or loss of length and restricted dorsiﬂexion may oc- cur. Anti-inﬂammatory medication may assist in the early stages, but it must not be a mechanism just to allow more activity, except in the case of care- fully managed rehabilitation exercises like Alfred- son’s regime. Biomechanical causes may be positively inﬂu- enced by orthotics alongside modifying technique and possibly the training programme. Mobilisation of sub-talar or talo-calcaneal joint eversion may help in improving alignment (Harper 1991) and creating more tolerant stress variability. Taping to support the tendon may assist recovery, and in acute or stubborn cases bracing or a cast can be used initially. Tissue release massage techniques can assist in reducing tightness in the calf complex, especially when the athlete is going through the protective phase (David- son et al.1997). Poor clinical evidence supported the use of deep friction massage in a Cochrane review in 2002 showing no obvious beneﬁt, although the reviewers were not evaluating Achilles tendons in particular (Brosseau et al.2002)."}

Corticosteroid injection may be used in chronic situations, however an injection directly into the tendon is not recommended as it may increase the risk of a total rupture. Rehabilitation is essential otherwise the condition is likely to return with increased loading. Wallmann’s (2000) and Alfredson et al.

In summary, if you look after this injury early enough and rehabilitate the tendon properly you should make a good recovery. Investigators have evaluated the close correlation between good clinical results with eccentric training (Niesen-Vertommen et al.1992) and a marked reduction in neovascular- isation of the tendon (Ohberg et al.2004; Knobloch 2007).

Injuries to the middle of the foot Midfoot stress fractures Stress fractures occur as a result of prolonged re- peated loads on the foot in the navicular, talus and metatarsals, usually the second, third and fourth (Snyder et al.2006). Long distance runners are par- ticularly susceptible to this type of injury and expe- rience pain in the affected bone during and when established, after exercise when resting and even pain at night. The nature of the running process, especially with an increased forefoot loading may help to explain the incidence of stress fractures of the metatarsals under fatiguing loading conditions (Weist et al.2004). There may be palpable tender- ness and swelling at the speciﬁc point of the injury, but not always. The navicular bone is subject to one of the most common stress fractures seen in athletes, especially those involved in sprinting and higher foot impact sports like high jump. It presents with a poorly lo- calised midfoot ache particularly during and after activity."}

It is usually sensitive to direct pres- sure on the navicular, and can be picked up with a bone scan, CT or MRI, but may not be evident on X-ray. The talus is more susceptible to developing a stress fracture in activities where the ankle is repeatedly everted and plantarﬂexed as in footballers changing direction and jumping athletes. Surgery to remove the lateral process of the talus bone is sometimes done, which can speed up the healing and rehabilita- tion process. There tends to be a gradual onset pain on the outside of the ankle with palpable tenderness and sometimes swelling over the sinus tarsi. The sinus tarsi is a small osseous canal which runs into the ankle under the talus bone and can become inﬂamed, leading to discomfort anterior to the lateral malleolus (Frey et al.1999), Sinus tarsi syndrome can be caused from overuse in conjunction with poor foot biomechanics usually associated with a past ankle inversion sprain (Breitenseher et al.1997). Running a curve or bend on an athletics track makes the left foot painful. Passive inversion of the subtalar joint elicits pain."}

Treatment and rehabilitation Treatment for stress fractures is initially very light to non-weight bearing with crutches and possibly immobilisation in a boot or cast for several weeks until the palpable tenderness disappears (Dugan and Weber 2007). Insoles or orthotics, which support and change the line of stress though the foot, are prudent (Finestone et al.1999). Gradual progressive loading over several weeks, depending on the intensity of the sport back towards full activity is essential. It is im- portant to mobilise the stiff ankle, subtalar and mid- tarsal joints. Increase in dorsiﬂexion by controlled lunging exercises and hydrotherapy helps unload pressure on the midfoot. Oral analgesics, as required, are considered preferable to anti-inﬂammatories, as they may inhibit repair (Harder and An 2003). Midfoot tendinopathy The extensor tendons on the dorsum of the foot can become inﬂamed causing pain and swelling, espe- cially when the tendons are passively stretched.

It is usually exacerbated by running related sports, particularly by repeated braking and hills, where the extensors lift the foot, or downhill where they work eccentrically to slow the foot (Scott et al.2005). It can also be triggered by a change in training regime, terrain or slippery surfaces. There is always the possibility of an underlying metatarsal stress fracture indicated by resting and night pain, or when the forefoot is passively deviated. Flexor tendinopathy of ﬂexor digitorum longus and the ﬂexor hallucis longus can also occur in propulsive and repetitive jumping sports like basket- ball. With peroneal tendinopathy the peronius brevis and longus assists plantarﬂexion and eversion. Its tendon attaches to the ﬁfth metatarsal on the lateral aspect of the foot and may become very tight in distance runners. There may be swelling on the outside of the ankle or heel and pain is directly activity related, espe- cially with sports requiring stability and sideways movement like raquet sports or movement on un- even ground and slopes.

Causal factors may include overuse, inﬂexibility, and equipment problems, but tendon degeneration and biomechan- ical considerations should be included. More re- search is needed to determine the signiﬁcance of stress-shielding and compression in tendinopathy. This ﬁnding may signiﬁcantly alter the approach in both prevention and treatment through exercise ther- apy. Current biomechanical studies indicate that cer- tain joint positions are more likely to place tensile stress on the area of the tendon commonly affected by tendinopathy (Almekinders et al.2003). Treatment and rehabilitation Rest, reducing aggravating movement is effective as it is primarily an overuse injury. A rehabilitation schedule is essential to strengthen the extensor muscles and stretch the antagonistic calf muscles.

Tibialis posterior syndrome The tibialis posterior muscle comes from the pos- terior tibia and its tendon passes behind the medial malleolus, passing under the foot to help support the medial arch. With cumulative impact, inﬂammation may occur around the posterior medial malleolus and under the foot where the tendon attaches, with pain as the tendon slides in the sheath (tenosynovitis) during exercise. The syndrome is usually associated with an increase in weight bearing ankle evertion and foot pronation. Athletes with this condition may present with plano-valgus (ﬂattened arch) deformity and often play sports with sudden stop-start or push- off activity, such as soccer, football, and basketball. Patients typically complain of pain inferior to the medial malleolus and decreased range of movement. Treatment and rehabilitation Rest for a few of weeks may resolve acute episodes but support by insole or orthotic may be necessary longer term (Kulig et al.2009).

The foot may beneﬁt from being placed in a boot to immobilise, and crutches to reduce weight on the foot. Management primarily to mobilise the joints around the painful complex, alongside orthotic devices to distribute the weight away from the joint, limiting motion at the joint, may relieve pain. Non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs may be helpful in reducing the pain and inﬂammation. If symptoms are not adequately relieved with non- surgical treatment, surgery could involve removal of the abnormal connection, or arthrodesis (perma- nent fusion) of the joint.

They will avoid forcefully pushing off with the foot. Lateral, side-to-side sports, such as tennis or squash, place the greatest strain on this area. Treatment and rehabilitation There is some debate (Patterson 2006) whether the cuboid can or needs to be passively manipulated back into position.

Neural signs The metatarsal bones sometimes appear to compress the nerve between the metatarsal bones causing it to be painful or sensory loss particularly between the 3rd and 4th metatarsals. This may be caused by a benign mass (neuroma) on the plantar digital nerve between the toes.

According to Prentice and Arnheim (2005), this type of injury most commonly occurs due to structural deformities of the foot, changes in training surfaces, training errors, or wearing inappropriate shoes. Additional causes may include a sudden change in training patterns, hill running, running on hard surfaces, or increasing the amount of mileage. The second, third and fourth metatarsals are the most susceptible (Brukner et al.1999).

Treatment and rehabilitation It is important to differentiate between the acute trau- matic fracture sometimes called a ‘Jones’ fracture in the slower healing area of the metatarsal and the chronic repetitive fatigue stress fracture as manage- ment is signiﬁcantly different (Fetzer and Wright 2006). Although surgery can now be more readily considered, as after a small puncture in the skin, and possibly bone graft and added blood cells to pro- mote healing, a pin is put into the metatarsal across the fracture and athletes are allowed to mobilise and partially weight-bear in a boot immediately follow- ing surgery, which reduces stiffness and rehabilita- tion time (Casillas and Strom 2006). Rehabilitation is an essential part of recovery, maintaining mobility of the foot (Brukner and Ben- nell 1997). Exercise, starting in a single plane with bike, elliptical trainer and hydrotherapy, monitored according to swelling and discomfort, progressing to full activities with twisting and pivoting by around 8–10 weeks. There may be some predisposition in the align- ment of the leg and the foot, particularly in genu varum or slightly bow legged individuals incurring increased stress on the outside of the foot including the ﬁfth metatarsal. Also, if the sub-talar and par- ticularly talo-calcaneal joint is stiff, the foot cannot adapt to uneven ground or leg to surface angles. This, combined with an unstable or loose ankle, stress to the peroneal tendons, and stress fracture of the ﬁfth metatarsal are the result of repetitive inversion sprains. There is evidence (Yu et al.2007) that using off-the-shelf foot orthoses with medial arch support may cause increased plantar forces and pressures on the ﬁfth metatarsal, thereby increasing the risk for proximal fracture of the ﬁfth metatarsal Being aware of soreness along the lateral foot is important, particularly following activity which usually dissi- pates by the following day."}

In persistent cases a sesamoidectomy (removal) may be necessary, but this can severely compromise normal foot function, especially in sport, and should be avoided. Summary To avoid a signiﬁcant foot and lower leg injury in sport requires the development a comprehensive incrementally progressive training plan. Planning a training programme requires preparation, which stems from a comprehensive assessment of physical needs. The identiﬁcation of structural problems and their management by appropriate footwear selection, possible orthotic use, and the maintenance of mobility, stability and strength as a preventative measure are signiﬁcant parts of the athlete’s planning and injury prevention process (Whiting and Zernicke 2008). Our lower limbs have evolved in such a way as to allow us to perform complex activities, absorb impacts and generate signiﬁcant amounts of force."}
{"id": "2344", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "The articulation of our lower limbs assist in force production and absorption through use of angular momentum. The coordinated combination of muscles, levers and joints can allow us to kick a ball, sprint or jump high. Altered biomechanics which may occur through foot injury inﬂuencing gait play a role in the genesis of exercise related lower leg pain (Willems et al.2005) and should always be considered in prevention and re- habilitation. Screening systems have developed that monitor fundamental movement (Kiesel et al.2007). The information gathered enables the development of potentially corrective exercise programs to posi- tively inﬂuence individual movement patterns. They are equally effective in general ﬁtness and speciﬁc sports conditioning because they target the weak link in movement and may not only reduce injury susceptibility, but improve athletic performance. Case study 1 A 26-year-old female elite middle distance runner presented with left foot pain around the distal, dorsal foot, which she had had for one month. She had no causative trauma but had increased her mileage in training from two months prior to the onset of symptoms."}
{"id": "2345", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "She described her pain as a constant dull ache, even when resting and at night, which had been getting progressively worse. She complained of exquisite tenderness with ﬂex- ion and extension of her left second toe. She had tenderness to palpation over the dorsum of the distal second metatarsal and MTP joint. She was able to walk but wanted to invert her foot to relieve pressure by putting weight through the lateral foot and avoid- ing extending the medial toes at push off. There was dorsal swelling present proximal to and across the second to third metatarsals."}
{"id": "2346", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "512 THE FOOT IN SPORT Examination of trainers, walking shoes and spikes revealed that they were too small and the second toe was compressed. Damage to the second toe-nail and callus over the toe tip were also observed. An X-ray revealed slight ﬂattening of the second metatarsal head and joint space narrowing, indicat- ing Freiberg’s disease of the left second metatarsal head. Initial treatment plan r Firm orthotic insole with a metatarsal bar and cut- out around the second metatarsal head, to be worn as much as possible.r Non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory medication to help relieve discomfort from peri-articular tissue swelling.r Firmer soled tennis shoes rather than running train- ers. One size larger than previous shoes.r Hydrotherapy, as near daily as possible with deep water light contact running to maintain toe exten- sion without signiﬁcant loading.r No running and modiﬁed training to avoid propul- sive movement but maintain aerobic ﬁtness with increased body weight circuits.r Existing weight training programme to continue."}
{"id": "2347", "title": "Sports_Rehabilitation_and_Injury_Prevention", "text_chunked": "Later plan and recommendations r Larger shoes to allow normal movement without compression of the longer second toe.r Training to develop as symptoms allowed with progression in running in mileage and intensity.r Avoiding excessive braking, uneven ground and hills to reduce biomechanical loading.r Passive mobilising of toe, daily on waking to main- tain movement before walking. The athlete was able to train fully and compete in- ternationally three months from the ﬁrst assessment. Although symptom free the athlete was warned there will probably be increased degenerative change in the joint in later life. Case study 2 A 38-year-old male triathlete with right posterior heel pain for three weeks after a ‘half-ironman’ event, presented with pain on palpation of the distal lateral Achilles tendon insertion. Soreness was ﬁrst noticed, for approximately one year, as low-grade irritability in the mornings, particularly after longer cycles or runs, and competitions. Since the half-ironman he had been more aware of a ‘lump’ on the back of his heel which was sore to prod and was uncomfortable when driving to the extent he had to change the shoes he used to drive. He had noticed he was wearing his shoes down on the outside of the sole heel more than before."}
